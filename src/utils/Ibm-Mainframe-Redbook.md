The IBM Z mainframe is essential technology of large enterprises handling critical data and services every second of every day. While the IBM mainframe initially transformed business during past decades, IBM Z mainframe technology advancements provide limitless potential to enable future business transformation.

The IBM Redbooks video course starts from the beginning teaching IBM Z basics and the IBM Z flagship operating system z/OS. The course addresses z/OS access and interaction basics, data sets and data access methods, and operating system environment topics. No prior experience with mainframes and the IBM Z mainframe is necessary.

Open-source software (OSS) is widely available and serves as an essential component for enterprises in the artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) industry. Specifically, the open-source programming language Python is one of the most versatile and popular programming languages that are used in the world at the time of writing. This situation is especially true in the data science ...
 
This IBM Redbooks publication provides both introductory information and technical details for ISV IBM Z Program Development Tool (IBM zPDT), which produces a small IBM zSystems environment that is suitable for application development. ISV zPDT is a personal computer (PC) Linux application. When ISV zPDT is installed on Linux, normal IBM zSystems operating systems (such as IBM z/OS) may be ...
 
IBM Redbooks are developed through a unique program - the Residency - that teams IBM technical professionals with Business Partners, clients, and IBM product development staff. Depending on the market needs of a product or solution, a team of residents is chosen through a competitive nomination process and collaborates for two to eight weeks on developing IBM Redbooks. Would you like to join a team writing IBM Redbooks? Find an upcoming residency from the list below and submit a nomination!
 
Resource Access Control Facility (RACF) is a security program that serves as a component of the Security Server for z/OS. RACF governs user actions within the z/OS operating system, enabling users to protect their resources. It safeguards information and other resources by regulating access to them.
 
IBM RACF for z/OS enables the protection of your mainframe resources by making access control decisions through resource managers. Granting access to only authorized users keeps your data safe and secure.
 
RACF has logging and reporting functions that identify users who attempt to access the resource, either successfully or unsuccessfully. Detection of security exposures or threats is made possible by this feature.
 
And just to underline that mainframes are as up-to-date as anything else, there are now mainframe-related apps available that you can download from Google Play on Android devices and the App Store on Apple devices. So what comes as an app?

Had a fair day trying to convert our CMCI and WUI to move to a JVM server and all that was involved with doing so. I was fortunate enough to attend SHARE ORLANDO 2024 back in march (keep an eye out for that blog!) and got to sit in a lot of sessions about CICS, one most popular was a walkthrough of the CICS TS 6.1 upgrade. They had mentioned a lot of programmers first issue is the WUI not starting up and, in our case, causing the region to shutdown prematurely. This is because CICS, by default, switches to a CMCI JVM server (picture below). So, here are some of the steps that I took and some links I used to help.
 
As mentioned, my name is Jeremy Wiggins and i have been a SYSPROG for a little over 2 years now (yes not very long). I have a passion for mainframe and more specifically CICS! as i was introduced by Steve to this wonderful piece of software. So, where do i begin? Early of 2022 i was a store manager of a large automotive retail and service center and had my first born, Oaklee. As the 70+ hour weeks progressed i knew there had to be something better for me. I had a good friend in the middle of taking the Franklin Pre-Apprenticeship course that consisted of a lot of the IBM Z XPLORE and when he recommended i do it i took some thought and looked into this. So, here i am no computer, no experience just DRIVE! I took the course and challenged every bit of myself to learn just what the heck COBOL, JCL, SQL etc. even meant!
 
Meet Jeremy, a talented CICS sysprog that I had the pleasure of working closely with prior to my retirement. Recently, he shared an insightful article on LinkedIn about his experiences with CICSPlex on an upgrade to CICS/TS 5.6. It struck me that this was the perfect opportunity for him to take charge of this blog and share his expertise. With confidence, I pass the torch to him.
 
Since the rise of the personal computer in the 1980s, IBM and other vendors have created **PC-based IBM mainframe-compatible systems** which are compatible with the larger IBM mainframe computers. For a period of time PC-based mainframe-compatible systems had a lower price and did not require as much electricity or floor space. However, they sacrificed performance and were not as dependable as mainframe-class hardware. These products have been popular with mainframe developers, in education and training settings, for very small companies with non-critical processing, and in certain disaster relief roles (such as field insurance adjustment systems for hurricane relief).
 
Up until the mid-1990s, mainframes were very large machines that often occupied entire rooms. The rooms were often air conditioned and had special power arrangements to accommodate the three-phase electric power required by the machines. Modern mainframes are now physically comparatively small and require little or no special building arrangements.
 
In 1980 rumors spread of a new IBM personal computer, perhaps a miniaturized version of the 370.[1] In 1981 the IBM Personal Computer appeared, but it was not based on the System 370 architecture. However, IBM did use their new PC platform to create combinations with additional hardware that could execute S/370 instructions locally.
 
The XT/370 was an IBM Personal Computer XT (System Unit 5160) with three custom 8-bit cards. The processor card (370PC-P),[3] contained two modified Motorola 68000 chips (which could emulate most S/370 fixed-point instructions and non-floating-point instructions), and an Intel 8087 coprocessor modified to emulate the S/370 floating point instructions. The second card (370PC-M), which connected to the first with a unique card back connector contained 512 KiB of memory. The third card (PC3277-EM), was a 3270 terminal emulator required to download system software from the host mainframe. The XT/370 computer booted into DOS, then ran the VM/PC Control Program. The card's memory space added additional system memory, so the first 256 KiB (motherboard) memory could be used to move data to the 512 KiB expansion card. The expansion memory was dual ported, and provided an additional 384 KiB to the XT Machine bringing the total RAM on the XT side to 640 KiB. The memory arbitrator could bank
