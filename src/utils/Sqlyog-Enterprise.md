With mariaDB enterprise third party tools like SQLyog and Monyog (developed by webyog) are also shipped. Is support for these tools also provided by webyog or need to purchase seprate support package from webyog after buying support package with MariaDb corporation??
 
SQLyog and MONyog are actually redistributed by MariaDB along with some MariaDB Enterprise subscription plans. I am from Webyog and can assure you that we here provide support for SQLyog or MONyog. You do not need to purchase separate support package from Webyog if you have purchased the package support package from MariaDB corporation.Kartik(Webyog)
