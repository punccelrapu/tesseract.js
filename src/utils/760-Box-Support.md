A long-awaited Ukraine supplemental appropriations bill for Ukraine was finally signed into law on April 24, after months of deliberation. At USD 31.5 billion, the funds destined for Ukraine are only about half of the reported USD 61 billion and are significantly lower than the USD 39.5 billion granted in December 2022. The other half is mostly Department of Defense funding for procurement, operations, and maintenance and is not directly attributable as aid for Ukraine. There is still a large discrepancy between air defense equipment provided to Ukraine and the stocks held by the donor states. This is shown in the latest update of the Ukraine Support Tracker, which tracks aid to Ukraine through April 30, 2024.
 
A main aim of this database to quantify the scale of aid to Ukraine and to make the support measures comparable across donor countries. Much of the discussion on aid to Ukraine since the beginning of the war has been anecdotal, while a rigorous quantification has been missing. Our aim is to quantify the**support flows by Western governments to Ukraine** in millions of Euros, accounting for both financial and in-kind transfers. To do so, we set up a comprehensive database that brings together information from official, government sources, existing lists of Ukraine aid, and reports by renowned news media.
 
The Ukraine Support Tracker lists and quantifies military, financial, and humanitarian aid pledged to Ukraine since January 24, 2022. It covers 41 countries, specifically the EU member states, other members of the G7, as well as Australia, South Korea, Turkey, Norway, New Zealand, Switzerland, China, Taiwan, India and Iceland. Also, EU institutions are included as a separate donor. The tracker lists government-to-government support; private donations or those from international organizations such as the IMF are not included in the main database. Flows going into other countries like, for example, Moldova, are not included. The database **does not include other types of support**, in particular donations by private individuals, companies, churches, or non-governmental organizations. We have also not (yet) systematically collected support by international organizations like the Red Cross or the United Nations, mainly because a lack of systematic data and reporting by most such international organizations.
