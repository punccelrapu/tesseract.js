Cooties is a fictitious childhood disease, commonly represented as childlore. It is used in the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and the Philippines as a rejection term and an infection tag game (such as Humans vs Zombies). It is similar to the British \"dreaded lurgi\", and to terms used in the Nordic countries, in Italy, India and Iraq. A child is said to \"catch\" cooties through close contact with an \"infected\" person or from an opposite-sex child of a similar age.

The word is thought to originate from the Austronesian language family, in which the Philippine, Malaysian-Indonesian languages have the word kuto or kutu, which in turn refers to a parasitic biting insect.
 
However, it is equally likely the name originated from \"cuties\", a cynical reference to the same. The earliest recorded uses of the term in English are by British soldiers during the First World War to refer to lice that proliferated in battlefield trenches.
 
So now you know what \"cooties\" means. Let's play and try to use this word during a conversation and check if people around understand you ! If not, you will be very happy and proud to explain everything about it.
 
Cooties is a noun used in America implying an infection or virus that can be caught from someone of the opposite sex. Generally, it applies to children who tease each other for having physical contact with another person of the opposite sex. This is played as a game like Tag.




For native English speakers, the word \"cooties\" is introduced on the playground or even, on occasion, by parents. You are told by your peers that children of the opposite sex have these invisible bugs called cooties - which you could catch if you get too close or touch them!
 
The word started being used in World War I to describe body lice by soldiers. Although it started by describing a real insect, children (and most adults) are mostly ignorant of the word's beginnings and now use it to describe an invisible bug that infects those of the opposite sex.
 
Although this describes a non-existent bug you must understand that many children believe that cooties are real. Just as you can't see the virus that gives you the flu, or a cold (just the symptoms), cooties are viewed the same way. And children start using this word as they start understanding germs and how they spread (germs and cooties are almost interchangeable). You can't see them but you know that they are there, somewhere, just waiting to attack as soon as you play with a child of the opposite sex.
 
Cooties is a term used more by kids, but probably not exclusively. It means bugs, germs, or something unwanted. If you use this term about another person it's not a nice phrase, but it is one you hear kids use sometimes. 


 
The word cooties has two meanings in Midwest America. The first meaning is lice, the small insect that lives on skin and lays eggs in human hair. The second meaning is something kids say to each other, usually about the opposite gender, example: \"You touched him, now you have boy cooties.\" In this case it doesn't mean lice, it means something closer to boy germs, or girl germs, or just germs.

In these strange pandemic times, small children all over the world are on lockdown. To many frazzled parents, juggling home schooling, child care, work, and economic worries, in often small spaces, it may feel like living in some dark fairy tale.
 
With schools shuttered and education moves imperfectly online, many responsible adults are worried and anxious. Catching COVID-19 at school is a major concern. But if some children just stay home and play all day, how are they going to learn what they need to grow into happy, healthy, and functioning adult members of society? Will their educational development be stunted by this extraordinary break in normal life? Should schools open up earlier than other community institutions and businesses on the premise that children are not like other, older humans?
 
These are all valid questions. In this unprecedented topsy-turvy time in which nothing seems to make sense, the fragilities of modern society are revealed, from stark economic inequality to the stigmatization of some of the more vulnerable among us. Without formal instruction and supervision, how will kids make sense of a world where nothing is normal, where people wear masks and keep far away from each other, lest they catch something fearsome?
 
One of the lead researchers on the project, Ivelisse Martinez, witnessed the force of cootie fear first hand. Martinez was chatting with a group of nine-year-old children in a classroom (not about cooties) when a girl approached the group and sat in an available chair. Almost immediately and quite suddenly she became demonstrably upset. Martinez asked her what was wrong. The girl breathlessly replied that she just realized that the last child to use the chair had cooties.
 
As adults, astonished at the verses we may have playfully repeated as children, we may want to attribute meaning to them to make some kind of sense out of them. Other nursery rhymes have also been posited to be about other, much darker themes, with each line simply bursting with adult meaning. Some scholars may try to find meaning in the origins of nursery rhymes that were perhaps derived from adult ballads, stripped down to be more palatable for children, and therefore assumed to be more meaningful than just mere nonsense.

Unlike Wallace, who was both a genius and a bad man, or Franzen, who wrote with skill and ambition, Green wrote nothing ambitious and is nothing like a genius, while being a very nice man. He wrote a series of lachrymose novels about men who cry at the appropriate times, who never lie to their girlfriends, and who have never farted, and certainly never masturbated.
 
Men still dominate non-Fiction. The great works of popular history, politics, economics are almost all written by men, from the People's History of the United States to Freakonomics to A Dawn of Everything. I think men are disinterested writting fiction because reading novels is considered a female past-time. In the 1990s Oprah and other book clubs had women regularly snapping up bestsellers, while men's interest veered towards video games and stayed on sports and cable television. Today fiction is an easily consumable product to help middle and upper middle class woman feel feelings.
