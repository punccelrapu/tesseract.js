***Escape from Pretoria*** is a 2020 Australian prison film co-written and directed by Francis Annan, based on the real-life prison escape by three political prisoners in South Africa in 1979, starring Daniel Radcliffe and Daniel Webber. It is based on the 2003 book *Inside Out: Escape from Pretoria Prison* by Tim Jenkin, one of the escapees.
 
In 1978, Tim Jenkin and Stephen Lee; two white South Africans, are carrying out anti-apartheid missions in South Africa. They are arrested on the spot and prosecuted; Jenkin is sentenced to twelve years and Lee is sentenced to eight. At the courthouse Lee attempts to escape but to no avail. Transported to Pretoria Prison, they meet Denis Goldberg, an older political prisoner serving four life sentences for previous work against apartheid. He shows them the ropes but discourages them from trying to escape.

Jenkin and Lee discuss escaping with another prisoner, Leonard Fontaine. They settle in and go about their daily routines, but Jenkin starts to analyze the prison and think of ways to escape. He steals items from the wood shop to make wooden keys that fit the locks to their cells. He sneaks around the prison at night, making keys for other locks. Lee and Jenkin bury these keys in the prison garden while tending it and make many other preparations for their escape.
 
Fontaine and Jenkin do a test run by using keys to leave their cells. They hide in a closet as the night guard walks by. They use another key to leave the cell block, but they have to run back to their cells before they can use another key. The guards search everyone's cells the next day but fail to find anything. Later, Jenkin discovers that a new gun tower is being built. He, Fontaine and Lee present their plan to Goldberg and other prisoners who decide against trying to escape with them.
 
Jenkin, Lee and Fontaine execute their plan. They gather keys hidden in various areas and change into previously smuggled street clothes. Once again, they hide in the closet to evade the night guard. Unexpectedly, the night guard comes back to the closet. Goldberg short-circuits the light in his cell, causing the electricity to go out and calls for the guard, distracting him so that the trio can reach the last door. They cannot get any of the keys to work on this door, but Fontaine breaks it open using a chisel and screwdriver. They leave the prison and find a taxi driven by a black driver to take them out of Pretoria after offering him cash.
 
It transpires that the biggest manhunt ensued in the aftermath, but they managed to escape to London via Mozambique, and Tanzania. The three would continue their protests against apartheid under the African National Congress Party; they were ultimately pardoned in 1991. Goldberg was finally freed in 1985 after spending 22 years in prison. In 1992, a year after Jenkin, Lee and Fontaine's exoneration, apartheid ended.
 
The film was written and directed by Francis Annan.[5] The film is an Australia-UK co-production, co-financed by Arclight Films, New York-based Magna Entertainment and with the assistance of the South Australian Film Corporation.[6] Sam Neill was originally cast as Goldberg, in May 2017.[7]
 
Filming commenced on location in Adelaide, South Australia, in March 2019, with some scenes being shot at Mitcham railway station and others in the centre of the city, in Pirie Street.[3][8] Jenkin spent some time in Adelaide, advising Radcliffe on accent and other aspects of the film, as well as playing as an extra, playing a prisoner next to Radcliffe in the visiting room.[9][10]
 
The film contains two pieces of music by the Austrian composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart: The Dies Irae from his Requiem Mass in D minor and the Kyrie from his Mass in C minor. The latter was also featured prominently in a classic prison film, *A Man Escaped* directed by Robert Bresson.

*Escape from Pretoria* was released on 6 March 2020 in the United Kingdom by Signature Entertainment and in the United States by eOne and Momentum Pictures.[11] It was released for rental on digital platforms iTunes, Sky Store, Amazon Prime Video and Virgin on the same date, and had a limited cinema release in the UK, US and some other countries.[12] It became available to buy on DVD and Blu-ray from 20 April 2020.[12]
 
On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 73% based on 44 reviews, with an average rating of 6.4/10. The website's critics consensus reads: "*Escape from Pretoria* doesn't quite do justice to the fact-based story it's dramatizing, but that lack of depth is offset by suitably gripping jailbreak action."[14] On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 56 out of 100, based on 7 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".[15]
 
Prison escape movies are a thrilling subgenre that has been around for decades and continues to be a draw today. Careful planning, coordination, and perfect execution are what it takes to successfully complete this kind of mission and some are not always lucky. Fans will find both among the best movies of this genre. From classics of the Golden Era of Hollywood to more recent adventures, prison escape movies carry a lasting legacy.
 
There's nothing quite like a character's desperate, determined, and dangerous attempt at freedom, whether they are innocent victims or endearing anti-heroes who belong in jail. However, while the concept of characters breaking out of their confinement might seem like a limiting genre, audiences might be surprised by how varied prison escape movies can be. From intense dramas to family-friendly comedies to epic adventures, these prison escape movies stand out in the genre.
 
Based on a much-disputed legend of a **long walk to freedom taken by escaped prisoners** **from a Siberian gulag**, The Way Back is a sprawling period drama in the spirit of director Peter Weir's most sweeping epics. The gulag presents a brutal and inhumane fate for these prisoners with the audience desperately hoping they can be freed from it. The escape from the gulag is really the simplest part of the main characters' ordeal but, of course, that isn't their real prison.
 
Their 4000-mile journey across just about every kind of beautifully barren landscape imaginable wears them down to their cores and Weir never loses sight of the emotional details even in the most enormous backdrops. It becomes as much a survival movie as a prison escape movie with the prisoners facing the harsh elements, including freezing temperatures and vicious animals. **The movie features a strong ensemble, including Saoirse Ronan, Ed Harris, and Colin Farrell.**
 
A dramatization of life in**a boy's prison on the Norwegian island of Basty in the early 20th century**which leads to an insurrection by the detainees, King of Devil's Island is an unforgiving but deeply affecting drama.
 
The story begins with a new arrival at the Basty prison island where he befriends the other prisoners and attempts to fight back against the abuse and corruption he witnesses at the prison. **Stellan Skarsgrd leads a talented cast as the critically out-of-touch director of the prison.**
 
However, it's the boys themselves who shine the brightest, creating an enveloping criminal world and unbreakably tough bonds of loyalty that could go toe to toe with the most seasoned gangster sagas.**It is a harrowing story of a place that is meant to serve justice yet offers none to the young inmates,**pushing them to the point of desperate acts.
 
Jim Jarmusch directed the black-and-white prison escape movie Down By Law starring Tom Waits, John Lurie, and Roberto Benigni. **Waits and Lurie play two men who are set up for a crime they did not commit** while Benigni is a tourist who is locked up for accidental manslaughter.
 
While most prison escape films focus on these complicated and intricate schemes of escaping, this one is unique in **focusing on how these convicts interact with each other**, presenting a charming and hilarious trio who form a unique dynamic.
 
War movies and prison escape movies often overlap, as is the case with the French film The Grand Illusion from reserved French auteur Jean Renoir. The story follows **two French pilots who are shot down and captured during World War I**.
 
After being taken to a German POW camp, they continue to fuel their pride in the French war effort. **They continuously attempt to escape before being sent to a seemingly inescapable prison.**
 
Much like with the director's following masterpiece, The Rules of the Game, the insights into European culture and its decay are made incomparably poignant by the film's proximity to the beginning of the Second World War. It is a thought-provoking look at the futility of war and the humanity at the center of these conflicts. The Grand Illusion holds the distinction of being the first foreign language movie nominated for Best Picture at the Academy Awards.
 
Another prison escape movie from the earlier days of motion pictures, I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang has the added impact of being based on a true story. Adapted from the **experiences of Robert Elliott Burns on a Georgia chain gang** after returning home to a life of a drifter from World War I, this 1930s Best Picture nominee is just as exciting and pertinent today as it was almost a century ago.
 
I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang may not sound like a movie with as wide a scope as it has but the barbarity of the chain gang itself is only a part of the story's depiction of the wider prison of a corrupt and self-perpetuating criminal system. In an age in which the movies had a very clear cut idea of what prisoners are and the kind of people who find themselves in those situations, this starkly realistic drama showed that there were complexities to the world.
