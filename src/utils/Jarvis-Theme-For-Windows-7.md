To install "Jarvis" theme you need to have a working version of WordPress already installed. For informationin regards to installing the WordPress platform please see the WordPress Codex or check this great video tutorial.
 
Update WordPress: To ensure a positive user experience, we highly recommend you to update your WordPress to thelatest stable. This will help to ensure that you are able to utilize all of the latest features ofWordPress.
 
In order to make the theme look exactly as at demo page you need to install recommended plugins. Click on **Begin installing plugins** link. Please be aware that *ThemeREX Utilities* plugin is required for this theme to work properly.
 
You will be redirected to plugins installation page. Check all listed plugins, select **Install** option and click on **Apply**button. Installation may take few minutes, please be patient and do not refresh the page.


 
In case fonts or color styles/schemes (accent styles), for some reason (for example after the theme update) fall back to their default settings/values, then you need to regenerate the styles and colors again. All you need to do is just click on **"Save" button**. 


 
Another great idea may be setting custom permalinks structure to make them more SEO friendly and human readable. Go to **Settings** -> **Permalinks** and make changes according to the example below.


 
Now let's navigate to **Appearance > Theme Options**. It gives you control over most of theme settings from one place. There are quite a lot of parameters here, but luckily the majority of them have default values thatsuit most of the users. We will take a closer look at them a bit later. Now just a few words about how it all works to give you an idea of our Settings Inheritance System
 
IMPORTANT:One of the most important theme features is **Settings Inheritance System**. You can flexibly control the appearance and behaviour of the whole website and individual pages, posts and categories. You can set individual display styles, sliders, output settings of pagecomponents (posts), and many more for the required category or for each post separately. In other words **you can set global styles and then change them for certain post/page types and each single page/post/category individually**. These changes will override global styles affecting selected elements and their descendant elements.


 
First, you should navigate to **Appearance > Theme Options** and set global options that will work throughout the entire site. Thesesettings will be default for all categories, pages and posts of the theme:


 
As we mentioned above, most of global theme settings can be overridden in certain post/page types and each single page/post/category individually. For example, you need to change style of blog stream page for category that contains Portfolio type posts. Navigate to that category, click the edit button and at the bottom of the page change appearance settings according to your needs:


 
From now on all the posts in this category and its sub-categories will be displayed in the style of "Portfolio(3 columns)". However hover-effect "Dir" will be preserved for them. Posts of the rest of categories(unless individual settings were applied) will be displayed as defined in Theme Options. Bythe way, the remaining settings of the category that were not changed (overridden) will also be inherited fromthe parent ones. If the settings were not changed here too - from Theme Options.
 
If you want to change the appearance of individual post in the category you should find that post, click the "edit" button and set custom parameters. You can find "Post Options" at the bottom of the post edit page. These parameters will override both category settings and global settings defined in Theme Options panel.


 
Now the page is ready for further customization with WPBakery Page Builder. Before you start, please check these WPBakery Page Builder related tutorials. They will give you a basic understanding of how to build a page properly.


 
The whole page is build with the following elements: Rows, Block containers, Content blocks, Gaps, Columns and Blogger shortcode. On the below screenshots you can see which backend section corresponds to a frontend section.


 
The background color/image for the page blocks can be customized in the **Row Settings > Design Options** tab in the WPBakery backend editor. Here the custom margins/paddings are set.



 
Built-in theme slider allows you to display Featured images from the posts of this category. You can select a category and specify the number of the posts displayed. This is a rather simple solution that can be optionally used, though we prefer using revolution slider.
 
After installation in the admin panel's menu an item **Revolution Slider**will show up, using which you can create an unlimited number of sliders, and then set any of them as the main slider in the menu **Appearance > Theme Options > Customization > Slide
