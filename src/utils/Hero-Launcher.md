Images take a while to pop in, the library only loads when you scroll past a certain point, and it's difficult to spot which games are already installed and ready to play. It's even sluggish to respond to mouse movements sometimes. But it doesn't have to be this way, as the Heroic Games Launcher proves.
 
On Heroic, I can scroll through my games with no pop-in, images don't take forever to load, and when I click on them I can see all the info I need. On Steam Deck, that also includes important information as to the compatibility layer being used to translate the mostly built for Windows games to run on Linux. There's a lot more to it than that, too. You can import the game, check Wine versions prior to installing, limit FPS, enable V-Sync, and more.

The UI is also much improved. The search bar sticks at the top even if you scroll all the way down to the bottom of your library, your most recently played games are the first you see, and your installed games are easy to discern from uninstalled games by their colourful portraits (which was something Epic used to do but got rid of in an 'update').
 
I used to think Epic was slow because of its beautiful big game images, but Steam manages to make its library very scrollable with similarly big pictures, and in the video I captured below you can see Heroic make easy work of it, too.
 
And you're watching cold boots for both apps there. I'd previously logged into Epic and Heroic, but neither was running in the system tray or in the background at the time I opened the apps from the task bar. The difference in responsiveness is night and day.
 
I have been hit with a few bugs worth mentioning when using Heroic. It doesn't always load up game details even when I'm on Wi-Fi but most annoyingly it had a moment where none of my installed games would boot anymore, and I had to reinstall a bunch of them. Frustrating to say the least, and lucky my Steam Deck is mostly used as an indie game machine so all the installs are pretty small. That issue seems to be fixed for good now, as I've not run into it again since.
 
The answer is quite simple: install Heroic on your PC. That's plenty possible, there's a Windows version, and that's exactly what I've done. Moreover, I don't know why I need a third-party app to do what Epic's own should be doing already. What I really want is Epic to improve its launcher on PC. However much I appreciate Heroic launcher, and I do a lot, something's already gone wrong if I feel the need to use it.

When you run Clone Hero Launcher, it fetches the latest update data and checks if the latest version number matches that of a specific file in the Clone Hero game files. If you're on the latest version already, it immediately launches the game. If you're not yet on the latest version or the game files don't exist, it will automatically download the latest version and install it to the current directory before launching it.
 
In order to build Clone Hero Launcher locally, you must have already installed aworking Golang environment on your development system and installed the packagedependencies that Clone Hero Launcher relies on to function properly.
 
Finally, to run Clone Hero Launcher, simply type ./clonehero-launcher in yourterminal/shell or .\clonehero-launcher.exe in your command prompt. If everythinggoes well, you'll see a full installation of Clone Hero by time Clone Hero Launcherfinishes its job.
 
When pushing to your repo or submitting pull requests to this repo, it is highlyadvised that you clean up the working directory to only contain LICENSE, main.go,README.md, and the .git folder. A proper .gitignore will be written soon tomitigate this requirement.
 
Note: If you have an existing City of Heroes installation (from Tequila or another legacy launcher), you must install the game to a new directory. The launcher will copy over most files (both game data and saved settings, costumes, etc) from an existing Tequila install if one exists.

The Heroic Games Launcher, or simply *Heroic*, is an open source, multi-platform launcher that allows you to install games purchased from Epic Games and Good Old Games (GOG). Heroic can use your existing CrossOver installation to run Windows games. This guide will show you how to configure CrossOver and Heroic so that they can work together.
 
When you first launch Heroic you'll get a warning that it can't open because it's unverified. Click **Cancel** and then right-click (control-click) the Heroic launcher app and choose **Open**. You can now bypass the unverified warning.
 
Expand **Settings** in the left menu and choose **Game Defaults**. You should see your version of CrossOver selected and the bottle name as **Heroic**. Change the settings to match if they are not automatically selected.
 
**Note:** While Heroic can download and install Windows games on Mac, CrossOver may not be able to run them all perfectly. Check the CrossOver Compatibility Database to see how a particular game has been rated. You may also need to change additional settings in CrossOver to get a game working. See the Tips & Forums tabs in the Compatibility Database for more information.
 
You need to have EPIC and EA running at same time in same prefix for the whole thing to work (if I remember it wants to check the EPIC account and the EA account to launch or something like that). So you need to install EPIC launcher, then from it you launch the game, which will install the EA launcher from which you add the game to your account, download it, and start it, and in theory it works after you do that. In theory. Good luck.

**Banana Launcher**Statistics Strength Health Cost-32SetGalacticRaritySuper-RareClassTribeBanana PlantTraitsNoneAbilities**Start of turn:** Gain a Banana Bomb.He only knows one word. But it's a good one.
 
This card has mediocre stats for his cost, with no strength and extremely above-average health. However, since he gives you a Banana Bomb every turn, he can be used to assist your control of the early game.
 
Captain Combustible is arugably the hero that can use Banana Launcher the best. First of all, he can use this as a cheap way to activate Re-Peat Moss' ability, allowing him to rack lots of damage on a zombie. He also has much more efficient ways to boost Banana Launcher than other heroes, such as Fertilize.
 
Another thing to note is that the Banana Bombs gained from Banana Launcher's ability count as **Conjured** cards, so Captain Cucumber can help this around by making them free. As for the other heroes, Nightcap and Spudow have their fair share of protection, being the **Amphibious** trait via Lily Pad and a wide selection of **Team-Up** walls, respectively. Solar Flare, however, has none of the following, so she has to resort to removing every zombie threatening Banana Launcher, which can be bad for her card management.
 
Since Banana Launcher adds a card to your hand at the start of every turn, he synergizes well with **Dino-Roar** cards, although there are better cards to use in that regard if you are playing as Captain Combustible.
 
Banana Launcher's weakness is his lack of strength, rather low health and the lack of the **Team-Up** trait, which are crippling for a plant that needs to stay alive for long. While the Banana Bombs he adds can be of some help, it is only a temporary solution.
 
Therefore, stat-boosting, the **Amphibious** trait or **Team-Up** cards are necessary to keep Banana Launcher alive for longer. It is also recommended to deal with any Quickdraw Con Men on the field as fast as you can, as every time one Banana Launcher activates his ability, each will do 1 unblockable damage to you.
 
Stat-wise, this plant is no threat at all. However, he could potentially ruin your early game by allowing the plant hero to damage and possibly finish your zombies off with the Banana Bombs given. If that is what you fear, you can simply use Rolling Stone or Weed Spray to destroy this plant.
 
But in the late game, this plant will be less of a threat as the Banana Bombs won't do very much against the tougher zombies. Still, be on the lookout for **Dino-Roa
