In order to apply for a tutoring position in the University Math Center, a student must take two math proficiency exams. The first exam contains algebraic/trigonometric topics and the second exam is a review of calculus concepts.

Exams are not timed and they should not be taken on the same day. Typically applicants take about 1.5 - 2 hours per exam, please plan accordingly. Books, notes, and calculators are not allowed on either exam. Students are encouraged to show as much work as possible on both exams: partial credit is awarded for correct work.
 
Hello, my name is Angelina. I am studying Computer Science and Mechatronics Engineering at Chico State. I plan on hopefully going into a career in cybersecurity or robotics. I enjoy helping individuals in STEM-based subjects.
 
My name is Asher and I'm thrilled about being here to help students succeed in their mathematics courses.

I look forward to persevering alongside you.

I'm a transfer from Yuba College who finished my BS in Math Education in fall. I am starting the credential program to teach high school mathematics and my favorite math is Calculus. I love math almost as much as I love the outdoors - but I can't teach math to trees so I'm settling for a classroom ?
 
Hi! My name is Yazmin Chiquito and this is my last year here at Chico State. I am majoring in Math with an option in Statistics and hope to go into the data science field. I am excited to be working with students and to offer help wherever needed!
 
We acknowledge and are mindful that Chico State stands on lands that were originally occupied by the first people of this area, Mechoopda, and we recognize their distinctive spiritual relationship with this land, the flora, the fauna, and the waters that run through campus. We are humbled that our campus resides upon sacred lands that since time immemorial have sustained the Mechoopda people and continue to do so today.
 
The math tutor center helps students learn mathematics and successfully complete their mathematics requirements at UNO. Tutoring is free and does not require an advance appointment. The math tutor center is in Room 105 in the Math building, and is open Monday through Thursday 9:30-2, and Friday 9:30-12. Further details, such as when specific instructors are on duty, can be found on the schedule for Spring 2024.
 
The Department of Mathematics has many computational resources available to students. Our computer classrooms/labs have been used for courses at all levels, from elementary calculus to the graduate level. When classes are not in session, computer labs are open to students for self directed study. During the COVID-19 pandemic, our computer classrooms enabled a smooth transition to hybrid learning formats, seamlessly integrating in-person and online instruction with an option for recording lectures.
 
The UNO Library has nearly one million volumes, as well as numerous journal and ejournal holdings. Mathematics faculty coordinate with UNO librarians to maintain up-to-date collections relevant to research activities in the department.
 
Our software library includes TeX, Mathematica, Matlab, ANSYS and numerous specialized mathematical applications and packages. We also have statistical software such as SAS and S-Plus as well as Java and C language capabilities.
 
I am a mathematics tutor and computer science tutor serving students remotely, all over the world. Patient, positive, and focusing more on students' strengths than weaknesses, I enjoy finding ways to help students to gain facility, depth of understanding, appreciation of mathematical thinking, and reawakened curiosity. I help students to discover connections between new topics and things they already know. My students gain fluency and confidence as they see math more as a coherent body of knowledge and as a powerful way of thinking, and less as a series of disconnected rules and techniques. I do all of this with a sense of humor, building genuine relationships with my students.
 
I am passionate about the subject and I can bring that passionate curiosity to my students, which helps them teach themselves. I have degrees in education, mathematics and computer science from Harvard, Carleton and the University of Wisconsin, respectively. I have taught high school and middle school math in the classroom. I am also a jazz musician, which helps me to respond eloquently to the moment.
 
Socrates knew that one-on-one dialog was the best way to learn and teach and that remains true today. The best music students usually take private lessons; it can be the same way with students of any subject. Private tutoring can surely help the struggling student, but it can also help deepen and enliven the education of even the most advanced. I have helped students to go from failing to As, and have also have helped already-thriving students in AP Calculus BC, and and all sorts of students in between.
 
If you're interested in setting up a free trial session, or if you're a returning student, please visit my new students page, then visit my calendar, find a time you like, and get in touch. (Please be specific about a start date.)
 
Do you find that you can no longer help your child with math homework, especially now that your child is probably doing more at home? Ask about how, while helping you to help your child, I can also help you to reduce your own math anxiety and to find it all fascinating.
 
I get almost all of my business via word of mouth. I always appreciate referrals, and please remember that thanks to remote tutoring, I can work with people all over the world. I'd also appreciate it if you would visit my social networking page and do the social networking thing with the networks you use. That page makes it very easy; just follow the links. Thank you!
 
I would have told him how important math is. I would have encouraged him to work harder, be persistent, and just sit down with tough ideas and eventually he would start to figure them out. I would have shown him that he could learn anything if he set his mind to it. And I would have sat down with him and helped him.
 
? All of this has given me perspective. It has given me a unique point of view on 1) how hard it can be to learn math and 2) how rewarding it can be to finally understand it! As a 20-something, I started tutoring students in the liberal arts. I taught public speaking, communication, writing, and Spanish. Soon after I started, parents began asking if I knew any good Portland, OR math tutors. I began interviewing math tutors. Eventually, I found a mechanical engineering student at PSU who was a good fit. He had a great ability to explain difficult concepts in simple ways. Soon I became a math tutor as well.
