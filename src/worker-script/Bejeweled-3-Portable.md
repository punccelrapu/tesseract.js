Although the Buddha is more often shown in plain robes, this highly ornamented representation is also recognizable as the Buddha because of the characteristic position and hand gesture. Many images of the Buddha show him seated with legs folded and with his right hand reaching down to call on the earth as a witness in his struggle with the demon Mara, who represents craving, illusion, and death.

Such an elaborate throne and Buddha image would have been an important fixture of a 19th-century Buddhist temple in Burma (now Myanmar), and similar ones can still be seen in temples there today. The significance of the crowned and bejeweled Buddha image varied in different places and periods. In Thailand and Myanmar, the story of Jambupati offers an explanation: At the beginning of his spiritual quest, the young prince who became the Buddha discarded his royal garments and put on a robe made of rags. After the prince attained buddhahood, an arrogant king named Jambupati attempted to display his superiority to all the other kings of the world. In response, the Buddha manifested himself enthroned in a magically created palace, adorned with royal finery, to teach Jambupati that the grandeur of the Buddha and his message vastly outshines that of earthly kingship. The Buddha then preached to Jambupati of the emptiness of riches, the inevitability of suffering, and the impermanence of all things.
 
Like royal thrones of Myanmar (Burma), this throne shrine has multiple tiers that step inward then outward again (see image gallery above). The lower tiers refer to mountain ranges that in Buddhist cosmology make up the world, with Mount Meru as the central axis. The upper tiers refer to the higher heavens.

At the top of this throne shrine is a miniature parasol, an ancient royal symbol (see image gallery above). In India and Southeast Asia, parasols were (and sometimes still are) held over kings and other revered persons to protect them from the sun and elements. Eventually the parasol became a symbol of high rank.
 
Expert artisans carved teakwood into a variety of intricate designs, then they coated it with red lacquer and gold leaf and encrusted it with jewel-like pieces of mirrored glass, creating a resplendent effect that recalls the art of the goldsmith. In the often hot, damp climate of Myanmar (Burma), wood is vulnerable to damage from moisture and termites. Coating it with lacquer helps protect the wood.
 
The Burmese kingdom began the 19th century strong and vigorous. Little by little, though, it lost territory to the British. When Mandalay was founded as the new capital in 1857, all of the rich coastal areas of Burma were in British hands, and Mandalay could conduct trade only through the British. Even so, the Mandalay period saw a flourishing of architecture and other arts as well as music and theater. The new capital of Mandalay retained power only until 1885, when British forces occupied the city and sent the king into exile.
 
In a prototype I am doing, there is a minigame similar to bejeweled. Using a grid that is a 2d array (int[,]) how can I go about know when the user formed a match? I only care about horizontally and vertically.
 
Loop through each item in the same axis (x or y), if they are the same as the previous item them increment matches. When the next item becomes different, check if matches is or greater than 3, call a function that removes matching items, and continue.
 
We have built a prototype for a Match-3 based word game, a little like mashing up scrabble and Bejeweled. We realized very early on that the engine that supplies new gems/tiles to fill empty spaces would have to be highly introspective (we run hybrid heuristics and MonteCarlo sampling) in order to create actual opportunities for a player to string letters to form words through the Match-3 mechanic. It's way more elaborate than the description but I'm keeping it brief because we'd have to write a paper.
 
To answer the OP -- we are doing pattern checks to score how many matches there are on any given gird, at the current time, through a method very similar to "gladoscc" code snippet. While it works robustly, the computational cost for running that recursively during the tree-search play-out becomes a substantial burden, so we are in the process of rewriting this portion of the logic and the data-representation with the bit-board methodology (commonly implemented in other-grid like games like chess, checkers, Othello, etc.) In tests we have shown that it can run over 20 times faster in ActionScript, and so for us the need to do it is a slam-dunk -- and frees up essential cycles for responsiveness, sound, animation, etc.
