***Shera*** is a 1999 Indian Hindi-language action film directed by T. L. V. Prasad and produced by Rajiv Babbar,[1] starring Mithun Chakraborty, Vineetha, Rami Reddy and Gulshan Grover.[2][3]
 
A Building contractor Jai Khurana (Mithun Chakraborty), is married to Police Inspector Shivani (Vineetha) and lives a happy life. Jai's sister, Jyoti's college, is overrun by drugs, and Shivani takes charge to control the menace. She arrests drug Mafia don Balloo Bakra's (Rami Reddy) brother K.D., which leads to disturbance in the life of Jai. Jai becomes an eyewitness in a murder case and is set to testify against dangerous gang leader VCR's two sons. But Jai backs off when VCR kidnaps Jyoti and blackmails Jai to back off. Things take a violent turn when Jyoti is murdered, and Jai transforms into Shera; the violent alter ego from his past. Shera wages a war on the Drug Mafias and takes the help of Chandola (Gulshan Grover), who was victimized by drugs. Meanwhile; the city faces a gang war between Bakra and VCR. Shera rages in action to annihilate the crime world, but faces one last betrayal in his mission. Muna and Tuna are also henchmen of Chandola.

Shera kills one of the sons of VCR and also starts killing his gang members one by one.Now VCR tries to teach Shera a lesson. Shivani was admitted at hospital and was taking treatment. VCR kidnaps her and blackmails Shera. Shera defeats everyone and succeeded to kill VCR and saves Shivani. After that Shera surrenders himself to the Police and he was sentenced for life, but the crime committed by him was for a good reason so his sentence was reduced to five years.

 The Transient evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEOAEs) are the objective evidence of function of the cochlear mechanism. This implicates also normal function of the middle ear. 
 The terms "**TEOAE**" and "**CEOAE**" they both refer to a OAE response evoked by a click. Although the term "CEOAE" is **more appropriate** because indicates that the OAE response is evoked by a click stimulus, in the majority of the studies in the literature the term "TEOAE" is used.

 The TEOAE responses are properties of normal ears. The generation mechanism is not fully understood yet, but a number of studies have presented evidence supporting that the TEOAEs are generated by a reflection of the travelling wave at micromechanical impedance perturbations in the Organ of Corti (**Kemp, 1980**). The TEOAEs can be also recorded **from other animal species**, used in clinical research, such as mice, rats, guinea pigs, chinchilla, rabbits, dogs, and monkeys. As it might be expected aging processes affect the amplitude and frequency content of the responses.
 The fact that we have categorized the OAEs in various types (i.e, TEOAEs, DPOAEs, SOAEs, SFOAEs) does not automatically imply that the generation OAE mechanisms are as many. There are studies which have reported that the different types of OAEs influence each other, and a typical example is how the SOAE peaks enhance the TEOAE spectrum. In addition, a number of papers (**Yates and Withnell, 1999; Withnell and Yates , 1998; Withnell et al, 1998; 2000)** have underlined the relationship between distortion product otoacoustic emissions and TEOAEs where high frequency components of click stimuli generate low frequency DPOAEs.
 The last few years the relationship of these types of OAEs have been attributed to the presence of two distinct cochlear mechanisms which gave rise to a **different OAE taxonomy** not in terms of the evoking stimulus , but in terms of the generation mechanism. **Shera and Guinan** (1999) postulated that the signals we commonly record, are the cumulative results of nonlinear processes (DPOAEs) and reflection mechanisms (TEOAEs). This hypothetical structure is known as the **two source interference model**. This theoretical foundation has been succesfully applied to distortion product otoacoustic emissions (**Talmadge et al, 1999**). **References**:
