The Hatfield greenfield facility is designed with segregation and sanitation controls for the separation of incoming raw ingredients to the finished RTE area. Floor coatings and door colors are indicative of hygiene areas, and there is automation in packing (robots, automatic palletizing, etc.).
 
Gray also designed and built an isolated viewing corridor for customers of the RTE product lines. In addition, the new operation features a 4,800-ton ammonia refrigeration system to support the process. There is a catwalk in the engine room for increased safety and control of ammonia system and hand valves.

If you run a food business you must tell us about any premises or a vehicle that you use for storing, selling, distributing or preparing food. Food businesses include restaurants, hotels, cafes, shops, supermarkets, staff canteens, warehouses, guest houses, delivery vehicles, market and other stalls, burger and ice cream vans. It is an offence not to be registered.
 
Being ready for inspection should include completing any food hygiene training and having a documented food safety management system in place. There are two free documented food safety management systems you can access online, these are Safer Food Better Business or Hertfordshire Safe Food Pack. Both of these systems can help you comply with your legal requirements.
 
I was able to pull the pork simply with a pair of tongs but two forks would work too. Can you see all those amazing natural juices? YUM! Besides how tasty this is why did I choose **Hatfield**Meats? EASY!! Hatfield is a family owned American made company with easy to use, ethically raised, natural meats! Have you ever tried the Hatfield Chorizo Ground Sausage? So good and a great one for a chorizo queso dip!
 
If you plan on keeping the food out for a while go ahead and leave the shredded pork in the slow cooker set to keep warm. Set up a little assembly station with the biscuits, BBQ sauce and pickles. I have to tell ya, the smokey pork with the sweetness of the bbq sauce, sharp cheddar, crisp pickle and buttery biscuit is a real winning combination!

College food insecurity is a known detriment to student success, but little is known about the implementation of campus-based programmes to help address this issue on campus in the United States. The objective of this research study was to determine the types of food insecurity initiatives implemented and assess how such programmes are managed, funded, and evaluated. A cross-sectional, 23-item online survey was administered among individuals involved with campus food insecurity initiatives identified through professional networks. Food pantries were the most common (97.1%) and mobile food sharing applications were the least common (14.7%) food security initiatives. A majority of respondents (69.7%) stated that at least one programme on their campus was evaluated, although the methods varied and uncertainty about the methods used was common. An allocated budget was provided at some institutions (38.9%), but funding mechanisms varied. Student Life Offices were most commonly reported as being responsible for programme management. Most respondents (75.3%) reported there had been programme changes due to COVID-19. This research confirmed that food insecurity programmes are widely available, although the type, funding, and leadership of these programmes vary. A coordinated approach on campus to align programming efforts is needed.
