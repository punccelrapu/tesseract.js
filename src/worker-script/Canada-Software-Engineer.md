Engineers Canada upholds the honour, integrity, and interests of the engineering profession by supporting consistent high standards in the regulation of engineering, encouraging the growth of the profession in Canada, and inspiring public confidence.
 
**Engineers Canada**[1] (French: *Ingnieurs Canada*) is the national organization of the 12 provincial and territorial associations that regulate the practice of engineering in Canada. Engineers Canada serves these associations, which are its sole members, by delivering national programs for standards of engineering education, professional qualifications and professional practice.
 
The organization was established in 1936 as the Dominion of Canada Council of Professional Engineers. In the late 1950s, the name became the Canadian Council of Professional Engineers (French: *Conseil canadien des ingnieurs*). In 2007, the organization operated under the business name Engineers Canada. In 2014, the official name was changed to Engineers Canada.
 
In addition to being the voice of the engineering regulators in national and international affairs, Engineers Canada coordinates the development of national policies, positions and guidelines on behalf of the engineering profession. It also promotes greater understanding of the nature, role and contribution of professional engineers and engineering to society, and undertakes federal government relations and national media relations on behalf of, and in consultation with, the provincial and territorial associations.

Engineers Canada is governed by a board of directors. Each engineering regulator has one or more seats on the board on a representation by population basis. All board members are volunteers. The work of the board is supported by Engineers Canada staff.
 
The Canadian Engineering Accreditation Board (CEAB) is a committee of the Engineers Canada Board. CEAB accredits Canadian undergraduate engineering programs that meet the profession's education standards. Graduates of those programs are deemed by the profession to have the required academic qualifications to be licensed as professional engineers in Canada.
 
CEAB is also involved in assessing the equivalency of the accreditation systems used in other nations relative to the Canadian system, and monitoring the accreditation systems employed by the engineering bodies which have entered into mutual recognition agreements with Engineers Canada.[2]
 
Engineers Canada negotiates education-based international mutual recognition agreements on behalf of Canada's engineering profession.[3] These agreements mainly recognize the equivalency of the accreditation systems (engineering education) used in other countries with the Canadian system. Engineers who are graduates of an accredited or recognized engineering program offered in a country where an Engineers Canada agreement applies are generally considered to meet the academic requirements to be licensed as professional engineers in Canada, making it easier for Engineers Canada's members to evaluate the academic credentials of international engineering graduates and for Canadian engineers to work and be licensed as engineers in other countries.
 
Engineers Canada has signed agreements with engineering organizations in other countries. In most cases, these organizations are based in countries where the accreditation of engineering programs is a key foundation for the practice of engineering; high academic standards of engineering education exist and are required for registration; and the engineering profession is well regarded either through statute or convention. For example, Engineers Canada has signed mutual recognition agreements of qualified/licensed engineers with both Hong Kong and Australia.
 
Engineers Canada has also negotiated a recognition agreement on full professional practice, the NAFTA Mutual Recognition Document, to support greater mobility for engineers from Canada, Texas and Mexico, and has developed a national register of qualified Canadian engineers as part of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Engineer Register initiative. An implementation protocol to implement the NAFTA document is currently being developed. The APEC Register initiative sets out criteria for the creation of national registers of qualified engineers, which would facilitate the negotiation of bilateral mobility agreements between participating signatories.
 
Engineers Canada has also signed a memorandum of understanding with the Colegio Federado de Ingenieros y Arquitectos de Costa Rica that provides assurance to the Colegio's stakeholders that Engineers Canada will continue to work with them on the development of their accreditation system. Such cooperation will enhance Costa Rica's accreditation system, improve the quality assurance in the Costa Rican engineering faculties and therefore provide better professionals to serve our communities.
 
Engineers Canada has participated in the discussion about climate change, has developed an Engineers Canada Infrastructure Climate Risk Protocol[4] and has been a delivery partner of Government of Canada on building capacity to assess infrastructure vulnerability of Honduras. This was one of Canada's fast-start financing projects on climate change.[5]
 
The Constituent Members of Engineers Canada are the 10 provincial and 2 territorial organization charged with the administration of the legislation that regulates professional engineering within their jurisdiction.[6]
 
Whether you recently qualified as an engineer abroad or have several years of engineering experience under your belt, moving to Canada can open a whole new world of opportunities for you. In this article, we explore immigration programs you can leverage to immigrate to Canada as an engineer, the provincial licensing process, and in-demand engineering jobs in Canada.
 
Newcomers from various parts of the world choose to move to Canada in search of a better quality of life and more lucrative career pathways. As an internationally trained engineer, settling in Canada can be an attractive opportunity for various reasons, including:
 
Engineers and engineering managers are in demand in provinces such as Ontario, British Columbia, Quebec, Alberta, and Manitoba. Demand for civil, mechanical, electrical and electronic, and software engineers, as well as engineering managers, exists across most Canadian provinces. Jobs in other fields of specialization, such as metallurgical and materials engineering, mining engineering, aerospace engineering, and petroleum engineering, are more prevalent in provinces where those industries are present.
 
Although engineering salaries may vary based on your field of specialization and the province you practice in, engineering jobs in Canada generally pay well. For instance, the average salary for civil engineers in Canada is around $75,000 per year, with some engineers earning as much as $150,000 annually.
 
Canada welcomes newcomers with the skills and education needed to bridge critical skill gaps by allowing them to apply for permanent residence (PR). There are several immigration programs you can choose from to immigrate to Canada and get PR as an engineer.
 
The Federal Skilled Worker (FSW) program is an Express Entry stream that allows skilled internationally qualified workers to immigrate to Canada. Under this program, applicants are selected for PR based on their Comprehensive Ranking Score (CRS) rather than their profession.
 
Most Canadian provinces and territories, except Quebec and Nunavut, have Provincial Nominee Programs that allow them to nominate applicants who can help bridge labour shortages. After you choose the province you wish to move to, you may be able to apply for PNP directly (paper-based application) or through the federal Express Entry program.
 
While some provinces use CRS scores to shortlist applicants, others nominate skilled professionals to fill urgent labour market needs based on the National Occupation Classification (NOC) codes of their past work experience. In such cases, you will have a better chance of receiving a provincial nomination if the province is looking for engineers in your field of expertise.
 
Selection under the AIP is not based on occupation. However, you may qualify for the program if you have at least one year of full-time paid work experience (1,560 hours) in the last five years and meet language requirements. You will also need a job offer from an Atlantic Canada employer.
 
The provincial or territorial regulator will review your academic credentials and documents, including your degrees, transcripts, certifications, and course description or syllabus, to determine if you need additional education, work experience, or examinations before you qualify for a license.
 
Work experience in engineering is one of the key requirements for licensure. Most provinces/territories require engineers to have four to five years of work experience, including at least one year of Canadian experience. The only exception is Ontario, where Canadian work experience is no longer a requirement.
 
**Internationally qualified engineers can start their licensing process before they arrive but must typically work under the supervision of a licensed Professional Engineer to get the required Canadian w
