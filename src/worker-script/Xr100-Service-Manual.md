My brother just got a 2003 xr100 and it needs some work done to it. I wanted to do the work myself because i thought it would be a good learning experience (i figure they're fairly simple to work on) and repair shops charge an arm and a leg for stuff like this. Does anyone have a service manual they can email me or does anyone know where i can download a free pdf file one. thanks alot:thumbsup:
