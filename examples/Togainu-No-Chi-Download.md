**Game Name**: Togainu No Chi [AarinFantasy's Translation]
**Description of Proble** **m**: Cannot save/load or edit anything in config during gameplay. Result of doing so will freeze the game. I will have to go to task manager and force it to end. Right clicking in on thr task bar does nothing, pressing esc while in game does nothing. There is no safe way to exit out of the freeze aside from force shut down of the game.

**What did you already try**?

Tried following this thread on their forums. -togainu-no-chi-windows.html But nothing I tried worked so I followed a link in that thread to game crashing issues, that didn't work either. I'm at the point where I just want to throw this game out the window. I understand this game was released in 2006 [?] so it wasn't meant to be used on Windows 8 but I have read that a lot of people have fixed this issue and I'm just sitting here like, how?
I cannot return to my old operating system so that option is out the window.
 
Reviving this to say I have issues with saving and loading even now in 2019. Changing config doesn't work, right clicking the window to unfreeze it just makes the rest of the pc freeze up along with it to the pont where I have to Alt + ctrl + delete just to get rid of it.
