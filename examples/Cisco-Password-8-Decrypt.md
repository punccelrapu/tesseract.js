With the VTY password you will be able to get into the user mode but if you dont remeber the enable secret password you cant get into the privelege mode. Password recovery would be the only option in this case

Besides the afore mentioned tools, which will ONLY decode the "encryption" indicated by 7 in the command, the best bet would be to perform a password recovery. The relevant procedures are described in "Password Recovery Procedures"
 
hi All - we need understand how CISCO strengthen their password, the enable password or password is just hash 7 kind which can be decrypted by any tools but if you use HASH 5 which is nothing but MD5, enable secrete which uses MD5 hash and there is no way you can decrypt. the only way is to follow the password recovery procedure for the respective devices
 
type 5 passwords are really hard to crack, especially since Cisco uses I think the 'salted' version of the hash. That said, if you are willing to dive into some dark hacker cracker stuff, here are two links to scripts you can use (I hope posting those links does not earn me jail time):

There is no decryption as the passwords are not encrypted but hashed. Although it's also a cryptographic operation, it's not a reversible encryption but a one-way function. All you can do is to take many different passwords, hash them and compare the result to your given hash-value. The used hash-algorithm with type 5 is salted md5 which can be computed lightning fast on modern computers. If you know that the original password is not too complex and long, it should be possible with the given tools.
 
The triviality in computing md5-based hashes (and also that there can be collisions) make md5-hashed passwords a bad thing and nowadays (at least in newer IOS) pbkdf2 or scrypt is often used. These are the password-types 8 and 9.
 
I guess it's not JUST an hash. Given a fixed password, what you see is different on every router. So it must be an hash, but adding some other randomness or local parameter, otherwise from a certain source input, the hash operation produces always the SAME output.
 
Here's a link and a quick summary of what "salting a hash" does: To mitigate the damage that a **hash** table or a dictionary attack could do, we salt the passwords. According to OWASP Guidelines, a salt is a value generated by a cryptographically secure function that is added to the input of **hash** functions to create unique hashes for every input, regardless of the input not being unique.
 
I am trying to connect to a VPN using Cisco VPN Client in-build on Mac Snow Leopard. The problem is that I have only the encrypted password. I tried some web sites to decrypt the password, but it does not work. Any idea?
 
I'm trying to crack some cisco type 7 passwords, and so far, I did good realising the decryption algorithm described in the following exploit: -testing.sans.org/resources/papers/gcih/cisco-ios-type-7-password-vulnerability-100566
 
However mypassword3651 could not get decrypted for a reason, that the password is long enough in a way that salt reaches the end of "tfd;kfoA,.iyewrkldJKD", and then I don't know what to do, do I have to loop through it again ?
 
So my problem here is really with the decryption mechanism, in a simpler way, when the two first digits of the encrypted password are characters in the beggining of "tfd;kfoA,.iyewrkldJKD" eg t or f or d, there is no problem (the password is generally less than 21 chars and the program works), however if the 2 first digits are character are in the end of "tfd;kfoA,.iyewrkldJKD" like d or J or K or D, I run out of salts and the password gets decrypted partially, first half correct, and second false.
 
This is an online version on my Cisco type 7 password decryption / encryption tool. The code is based on the post [here]. It was made purely out of interest and although I have tested it on various cisco IOS devices it does not come with any guarantee etc etc. Unlike most other online tools I found this one will allow you to encode plain text too :)
There is as a similar Juniper Type 9 decoder [here]
 
So **I want to try and crack the enable password**, but i don't know what format it is or what tool i can use to brute force it. (Note the hash there is not the real hash, just a random hash i found online like the original)
 
Both the VPN settings mentioned above and the enable/passwd are not salted, contrary to what the hashcat.net thread suggests in Peleus's post.It is worth while checking this site: Nitrix Hash GeneratorIn there you can enter 'cisco' as the password and you'll recieve the common
 
Using Cain and Abel you should be able to crack your current password of 2KFQnbNIdI.2KYOU fairly fast with a dictionary or bruteforce. Not sure of the issue you are having with Cain but it should work (try bruteforce as well).
 
From what I can tell in the docs this is a "type 6" password and this seems to be related to encrypting a pre-shared key. "type 6" seems to be an improvement over "type 7" in that there is a per-device salt, though it is reversible.
 
I did some googling of the exact password line since you said its the default password, this article suggests running more system:running-config which will show you the preshared key (Reversing the preshared key). This was also noted in the CISCO documentation.
 
Type-6 passwords are encrypted using AES cipher and user-defined master key. These passwords are much better protected and the additional difficulty in their decryption is given by the fact that also the master key is defined by the user and is never displayed in the configuration. Without knowledge of this master key, Type-6 keys are unusable. The disadvantage is that when backing up a configuration or migrating it to another device, the master key is not dumped and has to be configured again manually.
 
8Ry2YjIyt7RRXU24 encrypted key is default but for cli it mean there is nothing set / no password. I guess that you are trying to access asa via cli.Just use enable command & press enter and you should be able to login
 
Looks like I go to device management, certificate management, then identity management. I assume that I add the certificate with the add button, browse to the certificate file, enter the decryption passphrase, and then add the certificate. Only, what is the decryption passphrase, and where do I get it?
 
Ah, I see. So you use the ASA to generate a request. Then use that request to submit to GoDaddy to generate a new certificate, use Windows to export it, then up it to the ASA with the password that I create. That seems simple enough.

Cisco "password 7" encryption should not be used because it can be easily decrypted. But it is because it can be decrypted, people resort to online Cisco 7 decryting tool to figure out their "forgotten" password. Instead of using the online tools to decrypt your password and possibly hand out your passwords to hackers, you can do it yourself with the 9 line JavaScript I wrote to simplify the process.
