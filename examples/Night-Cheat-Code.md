**Indian Bike Driving 3D** is a mobile game very similar to GTA where players can do whatever they want. It is also possible to diversify the game using different cheat codes to make it more fun. This guide will list all the Indian Bike Driving 3D cheat codes so that players can take advantage of all the benefits that the game offers. With the help of these codes, players can do almost anything, from spawning zombies to driving cool and big cars.
 
Currently, there are more than 50 **Indian Bike Driving 3D codes** that players can use. Unfortunately, none of them will add new weapons; instead, gamers can destroy their enemies with a bunch of cars that can be spawned with cheat codes. So, here are all the available codes and the rewards they provide:

**Cheat Codes** are special codes that, for most, once typed in the profile naming screen of *Shovel Knight: Treasure Trove*, can alter the game in various and often bizarre ways, some in minor, such as simply changing a color palette, while others in major ways, such as altering animations, sprites or even dialogue. There are currently 407 or so cheat codes available, some of which are exclusive to specific campaigns. A few other codes are input-based.
 
The majority of Cheats are only activated after entering the correct sequence of letters as the name of a profile. This will also allow a second naming for the profile after the code is entered. Once activated, a cheat code will remain active permanently for that given profile, indicated by a teal pumpkin symbol that appears in the lower left corner of the character's profile icon. Only one code can be activated per file and doing so will prevent it from earning Feats for that file. As of Version 4.00, not only starting Co-op Mode in *Shovel of Hope* no longer prevents Feats, but similarly any cheat code that does not directly alter the gameplay, being instead only cosmetic in nature (like a color palette swap), does allows the earning of Feats.[1] The only way to remove the Cheat Code from a file is to delete the file itself.
 
In May of 2021, Yacht Club Games met with the chain of sandwich fast-food restaurants Arby's to create new content for *Treasure Trove*. This includes unique features across the four main campaigns, which can be activated using external cheat codes. These 7 codes, originally engraved on character-themed launcher tokens that were given with Arby's Kids Meals, will change various game elements to fast-food related counterparts, and there even is a secret 8th code capable to simultaneously unlock all the effects of the other seven at the same time. Due to having been released to a later date, these eight codes are not present in the official cheat code database presented above and are instead found at the bottom of this page; furthermore, only some versions of *Treasure Trove* are compatible with these codes.
 
Two special codes can be entered in the title screen of *Shovel Knight Showdown;* these codes, being input based instead of the traditional ones composed by letters, make possible to unlock from the get-go all of the content and features of *Showdown* by bypassing their default unlocking criteria, with the first code being a temporary one, only active until a hard reset of the game, while the other is a permanent one, which can only be cancelled by doing a complete reset of the data of *Showdown*.

Furthermore, with the last update patch of *Treasure Trove*, Yacht Club Games introduced another input cheat code for *Showdown*, called **Character Gauntlet**. This code, only available during Percy's Targets (not in the story mode version), makes so that the playable character is randomly swapped for another one each time a flashing bonus target is hit. Also supported for cooperative play, this swapping mode is only usable through this cheat code:
 
Originally the *Showdown*'s temporary code had another use: since in its initial release, *Plague of Shadows* could only be played once clearing *Shovel of Hope* first, the code was an alternative to unlock the second campaign immediately, but **it has since become obsolete and inactive** after each campaign had become selectable from the starting screen with the rebranding of the original release as *Treasure Trove*.
 
*Showdown*'s permanent code also had another use beforehand; this time, however, the code still works. It serves to unlock all Challenge Mode and Sound Test entries for all campaigns, with the exception of those unlocked via Amiibo use.
 
Enter code **TR&FDNC** to start with Plains and Village beaten, one Troupple Chalice, and the music played when the Troupple King dances is an entirely new track. This theme, Par-tay Rap!, was first released under the name "Mystery" with the original distribution of the .NSF files for the Shovel of Hope Soundtrack. It would be officially released with the release of *King of Cards* and *Showdown*. It's a secret song that can be triggered by enabling Theme Shuffle in Audio Options and then selecting random on stage select. If one of the 2 Troupple Pond Stages in *Showdown* is selected, there is a chance this track will play.
 
Entering the code **KUWA-GATA** will enable all the minute graphical changes found in the JP version of Shovel Knight with a few extras, such as more frames of animation in some enemies, some background animations and animesque changes to some dialogue portraits.
 
Enabling this cheat will create a special file of Shovel Knight, which has all relics, 6 Health, 60 Magic, Dynamo Mail, and Trench Blade. Then, you will always start at the first checkpoint of Lost City (said checkpoint becomes unbreakable), and are required to complete this level in 3 minutes. Notice that all random factors do not work (i.e. digging a specific pile always yields same outcome, and fishing will not take extra time). At the end of challenge, whether you beat Mole Knight or not, the total gold collected will be shown as the result.
 
Enter code **CC&ALLG** or **BJLHZXED** to start in a cleared file with every item, starts you on the world map with every level cleared (skipping the first level and intro), and you can begin New Game Plus right away.
 
These codes grant a custom color palette to the player, and remains the same even when wearing different armors. The exact palette for a given code is different in each campaign, and this cheat does not disable feats. Of note for the last cheat is that any glow effect on the characters (invincibility, charging etc.) will keep the palette of the previous armor and only change it when you stop glowing.
 
To enter a cheat code, select a new profile from the start screen, an instead of entering a name, enter one of the following cheat codes from the list below. A prompt will appear warning you that any of the codes will disable Feats, and a new teal icon on the character screen will confirm the use of codes. It is possible that you can input multiple codes by entering more codes instead of a profile name, but it is not certain if some cheat codes stack.
 
Don't feel like beating the game to unlock challenges, sound test and New Game Plus? You can use the following codes when on the main title screen. Simply hold B and input the following sequences - then release the B button:
 
**Cheat Codes** is an American electronic music DJ trio. Consisting of KEVI (Kevin Ford / Prince$$ Rosie), Trevor Dahl, and Matthew Russell based in Los Angeles, the group is notable for their 2016 single "Sex", which samples the chorus from "Let's Talk About Sex" by Salt-N-Pepa,[2] and their 2017 single "No Promises", which featured American popstar Demi Lovato and peaked within the top 40 of the US, UK and Australia. The track was certified Platinum by the RIAA.
 
Prior to the 2014 formation of the trio, Trevor and Matt lived together and later wrote and recorded music with Kevin. Their name was inspired by Kevin's brother who told him that he had found the "cheat code" to getting anything he wanted in life. "We really embody the idea that anything is possible. To us, the real 'cheat code' to life is loving what you do and we hope to convey that energy through our music," they said in an interview.[3]
 
In 2015, they released their debut single titled "Visions", which reached number one on the Hype Machine chart. It was followed by the singles "Don't Say No", "Senses", and "Adventure". "Adventure" reached number three on the Hype Machine chart.[4] The group gained over 15 million views on YouTube and later toured with The Chainsmokers.[5]
 
Before "Let Me Hold You (Turn Me On)" was released, in February 2016, they released "Sex" with Kris Kross Amsterdam, quickly gaining over 300 million streams.[1] Talking about "Sex", band member Matt admitted that the song was affected by divine intervention as it only took 45 minutes to write.[7] In August 2016, a music video
