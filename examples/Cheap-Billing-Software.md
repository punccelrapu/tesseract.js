Savings Plans is a flexible pricing model that can help you reduce your bill by up to 72% compared to On-Demand prices, in exchange for a commitment to a consistent amount of usage (measured in $/hour) for a 1- or 3-year term.
 
AWS offers three types of Savings Plans: Compute Savings Plans, EC2 Instance Savings Plans, and Amazon SageMaker Savings Plans. Compute Savings Plans apply to usage across Amazon EC2, AWS Lambda, and AWS Fargate.
 
On-Demand Capacity Reservations enable you to reserve compute capacity for your EC2 instances in a specific Availability Zone for any duration. Capacity reservations mitigate against the risk of being unable to get On-Demand capacity in case of capacity constraints and ensure that you always have access to EC2 capacity when you need it, for as long as you need it.
 
With Amazon EC2 Capacity Blocks for ML, you can easily reserve GPU instances for a future date to run your machine learning (ML) workloads. You pay only for the amount of compute time that you need, with no long-term commitment. EC2 Capacity Blocks can be used to reserve Amazon EC2 P5 or P4d instances.

A Dedicated Host is a physical EC2 server fully dedicated for your use. Dedicated Hosts can help you reduce costs by allowing you to use your existing server-bound software licenses, including Windows Server, SQL Server, and SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (subject to your license terms).

EC2 per-second billing removes the cost of unused minutes and seconds from your bill. Focus on improving your applications instead of maximizing hourly usage, especially for instances running over irregular time periods such as dev/testing, data processing, analytics, batch processing, and gaming applications.
\n
\nEC2 usage is billed in one-second increments, with a minimum of 60 seconds. Similarly, provisioned storage for Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volumes is billed in per-second increments, with a 60-second minimum. Per-second billing is available for Amazon Linux, Windows, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Ubuntu, and Ubuntu Pro instances across all Regions and AZs and is applicable across all EC2 purchase models.

For most customers, the highest bills are in the summer, when you use air conditioning the most. If your home has electric heat, your bill may also peak in the extreme cold winter months. With Budget Billing, you can find comfort in knowing what to expect each month because you'll pay a similar amount each month. Budget Billing is not a discount program, but it allows you to better manage your monthly budget by keeping your monthly energy costs predictable and manageable. Some months you will pay less than your actual bill and some months you will pay more to make up that difference, keeping your bills more consistent.
 
When you sign up for Budget Billing, we first determine an average monthly bill amount by simply dividing your total electric bills for the past 12 months by 12 and rounding that amount to the nearest dollar. This gives us your first monthly Budget Billing amount. Then we recalculate your Budget Billing amount monthly to make sure your average usage has not changed significantly. If there is a change, we adjust your next monthly Budget Billing amount. To make sure you are aware of this change, we will let you know this new amount the month before we start billing you.
 
Each month, your billing statement will show how much your actual bill is along with your Budget Billing amount. We track the difference in what was actually used versus what was paid. This difference may fluctuate up and down depending on your energy usage habits and is used to determine if a new Budget Billing amount is needed.
 
Budget Billing is a free program that averages the highs and lows of your electric bills by giving you an average price to pay each month. It is not a discount because you will pay for all of your actual usage, but with Budget Billing it is levelized. Keep in mind that your Budget Billing amount may change over time as your average usage increases or decreases. We will notify you a month in advance on your billing statement when the Budget Billing amount adjusts.
 
Customers must have been at their current residence and in good financial standing with Alabama Power over the previous 12 months. Additionally, customers must not have discontinued the program in the last 12 months.
 
Both programs offer an alternate way of paying the high seasonal bills. However, the notable difference is that FlatBill is a contracted set price over a 12-month period while the Budget Billing amount may fluctuate depending on usage.
 
On the current standard rate, you will have higher monthly bills as your usage increases [For example: higher air conditioner usage during the hot summer months and higher heating usage during the winter months (with electric heating).] With Budget Billing, the cost of your seasonal bills is spread out over a year.
 
Once enrolled in the program, a new section will appear on your billing statement which will allow you to monitor all aspects of the program. Included in this section is the actual dollar amount of the electricity used, the difference between the current usage amount and the Budget Billing amount, and how much total accrued difference there is between what has been used to date and what has been paid through the Budget Billing payments.

Medical billers and coders ensure insurance companies have the information they need to pay doctors and medical facilities for the procedures and services they provide. They also keep accurate statistical records, allowing healthcare sector professionals to track global health trends and make informed decisions.
 
Course materials typically include video lectures and other online training materials. Some classes run synchronously, using web conferencing to replicate the classroom experience, while others are asynchronous, allowing students to peruse materials and complete assignments at their own pace.
 
Medical coding educator Alicia Scott notes that self-education is typically frowned upon in the medical records industry. Scott cautions aspiring medical records professionals against relying on free medical coding and billing courses.
