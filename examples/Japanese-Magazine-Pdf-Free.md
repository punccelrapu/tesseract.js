The first Japanese magazine was published in Japan in October 1867.[1] The magazine named *Seiyo-Zasshi* (meaning *Western Magazine* in English) was established and published until September 1869 by Shunzo Yanagawa, a Japanese scholar.[1] In 1940 there were nearly 3,000 magazines in the country.[2] Following World War II the number of magazines significantly increased.[3] At the end of 2011 there were 3,376 magazines in the country.[4]

MJ Audio Technology magazine is the closest Japanese equivalent to Audio. However, MJ has been in print since 1924 (!) and it is still being published. Amazing. Here is a brief history of MJ, taken from the DIYaudio listserve (member tiefbassuebertr):
 
There is a store called Kinokuyina Bookstore that sells Japanese magazines and books in the US. They do not stock a lot of this stuff but can order it and usually have one or two copies of MJ each month. They have East and West coast stores, take MC/Visa and, will ship anywhere in the US.

When the Japanese decide to do a thing right, they really do it right. The current case in point is the cover art that Satsuko Okamoto produced for the magazine Teen Look in the late 1960s. Her fresh and playful use of color and pattern and symmetry contribute to her notable and distinctive body of work, one that any young graphic designer would do well to imitate.
 
I did figure out that the nice serif integers to the left of the price in yen (usually 80) signifies the date. You can see the numbers in certain runs progress from 2/11 to 2/18 to 2/25 and so on. Obviously if it was a weekly, the dates would be advancing by 7 days each time.
 
The magazine was monitored closely by the Japanese Interior Ministry, because it contravened the 1900 Peace Preservation Law that forbade any criticism of the system in place. This monitoring led to the censorship of two issues. In 1915, Raicho Hiratsuka passed the role of editor of Seito on to anarchist Noe Ito. The latter expressed various thoughts on abortion, free love, and prostitution in the magazine. However, the old members began to move away from the publication, and Noe Ito decided to conclude this venture a year later in February 1916.

The inspiration and excitement that Hiromi Matsuo received from old-time foreign and Japanese fashion magazines is expressed in the form of the fictional magazine RONDO. Above all, it contains her passion and support for magazine culture.
 
In 2017, with enough support and interest from the Gyaru community in Japan (and overseas), *egg* opened a new venture allowing the namesake of the magazine to return under the publishing of MRA Corporation (株式会社エムアールエー).
 
Egg is a style magazine for Gyaru fashion, distributed in Japan. It featured photos of ganguro girls and synopses of their tastes and popular trends. The magazine also usually had photos of the newest fashions, where to buy them, latest hairstyles, cell phones, and make up tips. It also had candid photos of ganguro girls on the streets of Japan, similar to FRUiTS magazine. *egg* had its own models which starred in every magazine. Due to the decline in popularity of Gyaru, the magazine shut down in 2014.
 
With the revival of *egg* in 2017, the entity states it's both an inspiration and revival of the old publishing medium, the *New Egg* magazine receives monthly content on its print media and daily content on its social media sites.
 
Along with the main monthly issues, *Egg* also released special magazine issues. One was a seasonal beauty magazine called "egg's Beauty" which used to be released each year, but later was typically released twice a year in spring and autumn & winter editions. Other special releases included "Manba" which was an issue published in 2004 when Manba was still a big boom in Japan, "Romi & Kana 120%" which was released in 2010 and was dedicated to popular and longstanding Egg models Hiromi Hosoi (referred to as Romihi in the magazine) and Kanako Kawabata's trip to Guam, and the most recent "Flowers" which was released in March 2011, and is described as "Girl's history of egg" which goes through 10 years of the magazine.
 
*Egg* typically used the same models for each issue of the magazine, some of whom have been involved with the magazine for a very long time. Every so often, these "older generation" of models left the magazine, and newer girls came in. Girls who left the magazine usually went to model for another fashion magazine, or would delve into something different, such as acting, singing or even setting up a clothing line, all of which were popular options. Some girls who left the magazine returned to a normal life outside of the media world and were very rarely seen in the public eye again. Notable Egg models Rumi Itabashi (formally Ringo) and Kaoru Watanabe who were part of the magazine for a long time have since left the magazine and have had children.
 
Egg usually recruited new models for the magazine while finding girls for "Street Snaps", usually in the famous Center Gai (センター街 Sentā-gai) in Shibuya, Tokyo. This appeared in the "Street Groove" section of the magazine which is a mix of random girls and Egg models. After a while of appearing in Street Snaps and small features and sections, girls could debut as more regular and full-time models for the magazine. Models for the magazine had public blogs which were followed by fans and usually contained aspects of their personal lives as well as things related to the magazine or other career projects.
 
*Egg* had a few other counterpart magazines, including one for men called *MensEGG*, and also one for teenage boys called "Men's Egg Youth". These magazines again had their own models who feature in every issue. *MensEGG* had a more grown-up and "rockier" style compared to *Egg* which mixed both cute and sexy styles, and *Men's Egg Youth* had a more colourful and extreme style. A sideline from *Egg* magazine was "EggMgg TV" (pronounced "eggmegg") which was an internet programme hosted by some of the models from *MensEGG*. Each episode featured different events that may have been happening in and around Shibuya, such as magazine parties or brand promotions, and also different topics related to young people such as relationships and dating.
 
The magazines were printed in 1968 and 1969, both turbulent years for politics which featured the May 1968 riots in Paris; the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr and the anti-Vietnam protests in the US; the end of the Prague Spring. In Japan, 1968 was the year that a string of violent student uprisings forced many of the top universities to close.
 
As well as photography, PROVOKE also had a huge focus on writing. It printed experimental poetry, as well as philosophical, political, and critical essays. Its founding members included art critic Koji Taki and poet Takahiko Okada, as well as photographers Takuma Nakahira and Yutaka Takanashi. Because the writing in the magazine was so important to its members, Lo was mindful of the inconsistencies that can occur in translations. So she decided to keep certain words in Japanese, followed by a short description in English.

**Sukiya Living Magazine (The Journal of Japanese Gardening)**is a bi-monthly English-language print publication dedicated to the special world of Japanese gardens and Japanese architecture. Every other month, this 44-page magazine discuses various aspects of Japanese architecture, horticulture, art, and philosophy. Topics range from centuries-old design principles to modern, how-to construction and maintenance techniques.
 
This website is intended to give you a feel for the kind of material published in each issue. It is our hope to serve as an educational resource, and we try to offer well-illustrated articles that are brief and focused on information that you can apply in your own homes and Japanese gardens.
 
In addition to the magazine, Sukiya Living Magazine publishes a Resource Directory and a few useful Japanese gardening booklets. Each year we hold several intensive training workshops for participants to learn hands-on techniques such as tree pruning, stone setting, and fence building. We also sponsor a variety of tours to Japan, including an annual JAPANESE GARDEN TOUR to Kyoto.
 
A couple of years ago, I had a little jar hidden away in the closet full of mostly green, white, and brown sea glass, along with a few shells and shark teeth collected from those little beach trips. However, a move to Japan two years ago brought beachcombing opportunities that I could never imagine.
 
Serving in the military and moving around a lot, little did I know initially that where I was stationed in Okinawa, Japan, is one of the top spots in the world for finding sea glass. Almost every weekend, with the he
