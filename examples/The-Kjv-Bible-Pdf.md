A frequently-asked question is whether it is possible to interface to the oBB. The answer is that it is, but that the interface has not been publicly documented. That has now been put right, and the web interface is described here.
 
In normal usage the oremus Bible Browser does not use cookiesat all. However, if you choose to customize the defaultsettings of the oBB (through the Set preferencesbutton, then your choices will be saved in a cookie that issaved to your computer and is read whenever you visit theoBB. The cookie only stores information about your defaultpreferences and is not used to track your usage of the site,and no information is passed to third parties. Third partycookies are not used at all.
 
Additionally, setting or unsetting dark mode sets a cookie. This cookie is not used or stored by the oremus server, nor passed to third parties. This cookie is used only to store whether or not dark mode is set, so that it can be used across pages.
 
A suggestion has been made that it might be helpful to compile apronunciation guide as part of the oremus Bible Browser. I would beinterested in hearing from people who might be able to help. Forfurther information, see this project page.
 
Version 2.2 has a new feature which allows you to dynamically toggle the display of verse and chapter numbers, footnote markers, and section headings after you have displayed a bible passage rather than having to decide in advance. These buttons will not remove these text elements if the text is copied from some web browsers into, say, a text editor. To do this click the 'Remove hidden text' button after clicking the required checkboxes, before copying text to the clipboard.
 
The oremus Bible Browser provides a simple interface to the New Revised Standard Version of the Bible. Just type in a reference to a passage in the box and press return or the submit button. In addition, the Authorized Version (or King James Version), and several other versions of the psalms are available.
