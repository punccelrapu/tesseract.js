The Nord Modular series, in common with their sister range the Nord Lead series, are analogue modelling synthesizers, producing sounds that approximate those produced by conventional analogue synths by using DSP chips to digitally model analogue circuitry.
 
The Nord Modular range approximates the much more flexible capabilities of modular synthesizers. Unlike most other analogue modeling synth hardware, which generally simulates one or a small number of (usually subtractive ) synth circuit layouts, the Nord Modular provides an almost unlimited variation of synth architectures, with the facility to simulate, in addition to subtractive synthesis, additive, FM, and, in the second generation of the series, physical modelling synthesis methods, as well as a number of other sound generation and processing techniques.

Because of the flexibility offered by these synths, patches cannot be programmed from the control panel. Instead, patch editing is performed on a PC (connected via 2 dedicated MIDI ports in the case of the first generation and USB in the second generation or G2 systems), running editor software bundled with the synths.
 
The Nord Modular line of synthesizers features a range of modules familiar to users of hardware modulars: audio input and output modules, Oscillators, Low Frequency Oscillators (or LFOs), envelope generators, filters of various kinds, mixers, audio effects such as distortion and chorus, logic gates and four sequencer modules,[1] which can be connected in almost any configuration- there is for example no restriction on connecting audio signal outputs to control signal or logic inputs (or vice versa), allowing for a great deal of flexibility in patch creation. Patches are only limited in complexity by the available DSP resources.
 
However, the more complex a patch is in general, the smaller the available polyphony is and, in practice, the specified full polyphony of the unit is only achievable when using a very small number of modules in a given patch. However, because of the flexible nature of the unit 'polyphony' does not correspond strictly to 'number of different notes sounding at one time'- indeed with some thought and careful programming it is possible to exceed the specified polyphony of the unit (by this definition of polyphony at least).
 
Clavia introduced the first generation in 1998. The series was discontinued in 2004 upon the release of the next generation *Nord Modular G2* series. The G2 is an updated and more powerful version of the original Modular (the G2 uses a new version of the Editor software as well), with greater polyphony and a large number of new modules to address the perceived limitations of the first generation, most notably a range of MIDI sequencing and output modules (the first generation's sequencing capabilities were limited to control of internal parameters, a restriction which many users felt to be the system's biggest limitation), time-based effects (reverb, delay, etc.), and physical modelling oscillators. However, there has been some debate in the NM community as to which generation produces the best raw sound, with many users feeling, for example, that the original series' filters had a more subjectively pleasing, grittier sound.The first G2 Modular serial number 001 was presented to Derek Sherinian by Bengt Lilja in 2004 to honor Sherinian for his high profile usage of Nord/Clavia products.
 
The (first generation) Nord Modular family consists of three hardware models: Nord Modular Key, Nord Modular Rack and Nord Micro Modular.[2] They are all built around the same type of electronics and use the same type of DSP. Nord Modular Key and Rack have 4 DSPs as standard (can be expanded to 8 with the Nord Modular Voice Expansion Board), and the Nord Micro Modular has 1 DSP (non-expandable).
 
But if you play synths etc physically with knobs, keys and whatsoever, and want a modular synth then the Nord is a very nice solutions. Although patching (connecting modules) is done via the computer editor, everything else can be done from the machine itself without a mouse. And that, for me, is a very big plus.
 
Yes , to use the 3 knobs on the unit. On the noodles I usually map the 1st to all the attacks of the envelopes, the 2nd to all timbre modulations (osc pitches, lfo sends, etc etc), and the 3rd to all releases of the envelopes. You can do pretty weird stuff. Also, these synth has the Nord Rack/Lead 2 engine, it is one of the best VAs in history.

I would also adventure after some articles reading that the Nord modular is still the scratchpad for ALL current developing Nord synths (still)? So basically there is a Nord Modular inside every current Nord
 
The Nord Modular is Clavia's Nord synth with modular abilities usingvirtual sound modeling. The keyboard itself is small and compact. Ithouses the synth engine and all DSP processors. However, the NordModular must be connected to a Pentium PC with Windows 95 or a PowerMac.Be sure to get the latest OS version which is v3.03.
 
The software is the Nord Modular Editor. It is simply an editor, but apowerful one that graphically shows you a the modules you want and iswhere you graphically make patches between modules and synthesize asound. It features over 100 modules! It's true modular synthesis meetscomputer synthesis. It sounds awesome too! The keyboard still has MIDIto be controlled and sequenced from your standard sequencer. Theprograms you create in the editor can be stored on the computer or inone of the 100 memories in the keyboard. Once you've created a sound youcan quit the editor program and use the keyboard controller stand-alone.
 
The keyboard has multiple outputs, pedal input, has a very easy andintuitive layout and a nice LCD screen. It also features a very goodsequencer! The Nord Modular system is expensive but it's like a Nord Lead 2 on steroids and without limits! Ifyou're not interested in the keyboard, a desktop/rack-mount version wasalso available.
 
Software version 2.1 adds many new features including a RingModulator, 14-Band FilterBank, Vocal Filter, FM Sine wave, Digitizer(bare-bones sampling) and many more tricks. The latest OS is version 3and adds more features such as a 16-band vocoder and Mac compatibility.The Nord Modular is already being used by **Astral Projection,Autechre, BT, The Chemical Brothers, Somatic Responses, The CrystalMethod, Junkie XL, Mouse on Mars, and Nine Inch Nails**.
 
2. The second thing I'm wondering about is the ease of use for the Micro modular, G1 and G2 modulars. Are they fairly Quick? and easy to setup sounds? How well does the Nord modulars fit into your studio in terms of workflow, getting things done/achieved quickly?
 
I like the fact that they aren't VA, although I see they have subtractive, additive, PM, FX processing. It seems like you can get a hugh range of sounds. But this definitely means it's a deep synth. And everyone that seem to have a Kawai K5000 or Kurzweil K2xxx will say how deep they are and you can pretty much get lost in the synth, especially the K5000. (What are the Nord modulars like in terms of making your sounds fairly quick and in terms of incorporating it into your music (workflow)?)
 
3. It seems the patches/sounds contain modules which are the building blocks of the sound, like envelopes, filters, etc. Can someone explain the Clavia's 'Slot' feature? How cool/useful is the whole 'Morphing' thing?
 
When you're tweaking it, making patches etc, you do the whole thing from the fantastic front panel, which has 8 knobs and 8 switches, with parameter LCDs, arranged in 48 pages (I think) - so you have really quick access + it's great for for x0x0x drum programming and analog sequencing.
 
G1 owner here. I would contrast the modulars with those deep synths. With those deep synths, it's like wandering around some large maze sometimes. The modulars can be complex, but you can pull down a wall really easily. Totally flatten the maze and rebuild sections of it quickly.
 
yeah, honestly, I really waited on getting the Micro Modular, I was totally intimidated by the look of it, but I went out on a limb and just did it and spent like 6 hours a day playing with it... within a week I was making my own patches from scratch.. and I'm no prodigy, it's just, if you are a graphic person, you can easily see what is going on in patches...
 
It's a bit of a learning curve, but if you go through it all first, looking at other peoples patches, maybe reorganizing them so they make sense to you, building very simple patches of your own, all of that, you start to see how it all works... it really isn't that difficult to make any of the traditional synth architectures... I've personally does the basic "moog", an MS20 (or tried...), an MS2000, all sorts of takes on the Yamaha DX stuff, Casio CZ, Alpha Junos, and others... Obviously you won't get the exact sounds from all these synths, but you can get a nice approximation most of the time, and it gives you an idea of it's range for "traditional" sounds...
 
I will say though, it can be hard to incorporate into a song... I found the best thin that worked for me was just building a huge library of different kinds of sounds, and usually, when I have a idea for a sound in a song, I have some patch for the Nord Mod that is similar, and just tweak it slightly... I don't recommend building patches from scratch per song often... you WILL get side tracked, and it requires a lot of time management... But I think this can be said for many, if not all modulars...
 
Did you ever want to layer a second sound just by pressing the sustain pedal, excite different filter frequencies at different velocity levels, rapidly but fluidly change a b
