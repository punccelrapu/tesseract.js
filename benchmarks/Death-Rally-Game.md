***Death Rally*** is a vehicular combat racing video game developed by Remedy Entertainment, published by Apogee Software and distributed by GT Interactive. Originally known as *HiSpeed* during development, it was released on 7 September 1996 for MS-DOS.[1] In the game, the player starts with $495 and a weak car named *Vagabond* (based on the VW Beetle), and must compete in deadly races where all cars are armed (although a game without guns is an option). The player wins money by finishing in front positions, collecting money bonuses during the race, fulfilling missions and destroying other cars. The ultimate goal of the game is defeating the "Adversary", the undisputed king of *Death Rally*, in a one-on-one race.

In October 2009, Remedy updated *Death Rally* with compatibility for Microsoft Windows and re-released the game as freeware.[2] A remake of the game was developed by Remedy in cooperation with Mountain Sheep and Cornfox & Brothers.[3][4] The remake was released for iOS in March 2011,[5] for Android in April 2012,[6] for Windows in August 2012,[7] and for Fire OS in September 2012.[8]
 
Each car can be equipped with a number of upgrades that increase defensive capabilities (armor), handling (tires) and speed (engine). While the default chain gun cannot be upgraded on any car, better cars are available for purchase, with default guns that have stronger firepower. The six cars available, from weakest to strongest, are the Vagabond (the starting car), Dervish, Sentinel (which is the best car available in the shareware version), Shrieker, Wraith, and Deliverator. Additional power-ups can be purchased in the Black Market. These include bumper spikes, land mines and rocket fuel. Before each race, the player can also ask for a loan and/or bribe a mechanic to tamper with the car of the highest-ranked opponent in the race (with the exception of the Adversary's car); this causes a random amount of damage from 25% to 49%. Reaching 1st place on the leaderboard allows players to take on the game's final racer, the Adversary, who drives a souped-up Deliverator with very powerful miniguns. Defeating the Adversary means that players become the new champion of Death Rally.
 
In May 2009, programmer Jari Komppa contacted Remedy and volunteered to prepare an open-source release of *Death Rally*. Since releasing the game as open-source could not be agreed upon, Komppa instead started working on porting the game to Windows.[9] Based on Komppa's work, Remedy released *Death Rally* for Windows as proprietary freeware on 20 October 2009.[2] The re-released version does not support multiplayer network games because the original code used for IPX networks would have been too expensive to adapt to the Windows architecture.
 
A full remake of the game was developed by Cornfox & Brothers and its parent Mountain Sheep, and was released by Remedy Entertainment for iOS and Android on 31 March 2011. The remake includes in-game cameo appearances from various different game characters, including Barry Wheeler from *Alan Wake*, John Gore from *Minigore* (voiced by Arin Hanson) and Mighty Eagle from *Angry Birds*. Duke Nukem also appears as an opponent, as he did in the original game.[10] By December 2011, the remake had been downloaded 1.8 million times, recouping its eight-month development costs in three days.[11]

Both the original game and the remake have received a generally positive response. The iOS version holds aggregate scores of 77 out of 100 based on 19 reviews on Metacritic.[12] The 2012 Windows port of the remake was not as well received, holding aggregate scores of 62 out of 100 based on 11 reviews.[13]
 
*GameSpot*'s Chris Hudak called the original game "simply the best top-down racer to come along in years, maybe even ever."[15] A *Next Generation* critic commented, "Once again Apogee reminds us shareware can be fun. *Death Rally* is a simple, playable, enjoyable combat racing game with a retro top-down perspective and a whole lot of action." He particularly praised the numerous ways of destroying opponents and the many humorous touches.[18]
 
Reviewing the 2012 Windows remake, Brett Todd criticised the controls, the repetition of tracks, the lack of any sense of speed and the necessity for grinding. He concluded "Arcade racers generally need to have an on-the-edge atmosphere where death can come at any moment via bullet or screwing up a turn. This new take on *Death Rally*, however, is more like riding with Miss Daisy, a genteel, distant driver as intense as a late-night cup of chamomile tea. There are just too many flaws here, with the flimsy controls, dreary tracks, and eternal grinding, for even the most desperate arcade gearhead to get anything out of this game."[16]
 
*Destructoid*'s Maurice Tan scored the iOS remake 8 out of 10. He criticised the lack of a tutorial, but concluded that "*Death Rally* is a lot of fun to play, it looks great, runs smooth, and it's very addictive."[14] *IGN*'s Levi Buchanan scored it 7.5 out of 10, writing "*Death Rally* left me smiling. Gaining new cars, equipping upgraded weapons, and blasting rivals is certainly fun and this is the best such mayhem has looked on the App Store."[17] *Pocket Gamer*'s Tracy Erickson scored it 7 out of 10, criticising the lack of customisable controls and the design of some of the tracks; "*Death Rally* provides plenty of cool weapons and rides, yet the absence of [...] tighter track designs prevent it from being truly killer."[19]
 
I would really be interested in seeing this go further. I always wanted different colors for my cars, as the player selection and naming system are very good already. Let me know if you've uncovered anything new!!
 
A while ago I was thinking about diving deeper into this. I'm not sure if I can discover the encryption method of the savegame (although I know it involves date/time as a variable). It would be nice to create a program that can modify settings. If I have more information I'll post it .
 
I decompiled de original Death rally(because i'm making a open source implementation) and i know how to decrypt/crypt the savegame files. Now you can edit your favourite savegame and give you more money or change your car....

I publish on my github account:
 

If your like this tools please, star my repo.

 
Interesting stuff, I am the guy that helped Doomfrost spread his mod on the internet, back in the day. 

I am trying to get the Adversary's car, but it looks like it's not an easy feat. I remember someone managed to did that back in the day, even though car controls were bugged.

Did you manage to get that car with the hex editor?
 
I just wish I could find a way to get the all of the tracks to not be limited to just Easy Medium Hard. All I can basically do for right now is reorder the track listings in a memory editor. Which has made maps like Suburbia show up in Hard listing.
 
Guys...someone needs to create a game editor for death rally...PLEASE one of you geniuses out there do it. I love death rally and wish it had different starts every time i load it. Player rankings, cars they start with, etc...it would be REALLY cool if people upgraded their cars on wins too. But for now keep it simple.
 
Hi,

Firstable, comments have been fixed in my blog now thanks.

About the BKP files we have a problem. I know that the palette is worng in my tool but if you want to put a custom image in Death Rally probably you need to change the palette, and as far as I know the Death Rally palettes are used too much. When I decompile I see that the same palette (256 colours) is used for faces, cars, menus and more, so I think it's difficult to change bkp files correctly.

 
You are welcome 

Yes, but it's also true that if you launch your DreeRally executable, the images are shown correctly as stated also in the screenshot of your project . So you have, even if "indirectly", a functional BPK decode algorithm for entire images. In other words, you can decode an image with its correct "shape" only with wrong colors.

(It's not your fault, palettes and/or BPKs should be bit rotated)

All this if I'm not mistaken, of course 

Can these considerations described at this external link be useful to you?

 =18&t=3601

I'm trying also an "inverse deduction" : if you take a screenshot from the game and cut out pixels of sprite for example for Sam Speed face, then save it in BMP format so you have the correct solution of which color should result in that particular pixel, and from here, BPK file and PAL file, deduce correct bit transformation.
 
Excellent work! Can't wait 'till you publish the how-to next week .

In the past I've also seen a screenshot with a player against the Adversary in one of the regular maps. In other words: play the final round in any other map than the Arena. Would that be the next challenge to achieve in savegame modding?

when i try to play death rally...
everything goes fine until the game starts,
(when I see mine and other cars) everything goes very slow ?
and i can't do nothing to it to make it disapear ?...
ive tried to start in "dos mode" by typing command...
 
I carefully read your posts concerning this matter. I've tried NOLFB, VMDSound. But it didn't fix my problem which is : I run the program using the /W parameter, it launches, gives some error messages (about the EMM amongst others), displays "Loading music & effects, please wait...". And it stays a very long time like that. I would say it's frozen. I've searched quite a lot on the net and haven't found any info. Hope you can help me identify the problem.
 
where do i have to put the /W exactly??
i did it by the proportions in the rally.exe is this good?
But when i do this...nothing happeneds
my problem is this:
Death ra
