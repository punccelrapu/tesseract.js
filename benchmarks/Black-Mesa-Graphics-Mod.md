my entire graphical display was destroyed after the restart. Parts of the image were no longer displayed, Dolphin windows were simply black. My graphics card is an RX 580 with AMDGPU driver. I then booted a snapshot, which worked without any problems. So no hardware problem.
 
That said, please always copy/paste things **complete** in your posts and not only the parts **you** think are important. Others may find that other things are important too. And complete is: starting with the prompt/command line (so we see what you did as whom), then all output, and the new prompt line (so we know it is complete).

On the Beelink pretty much the same thing except the cursor became a thin line making it very hard to close out any windows except for watching when the close icon changes color. The rest of the desktop and the KDE menu is trashed.
 
I managed to install Mesa-24.1.1-1585.1.x86\_64 from that mailing list item mentioned earlier and now X11 works but Wayland does not. Mesa-24.1.1-1582.1.x86\_64 is not in the mentioned repo. For now I have a working system pretty much. Will see what happens over the next few days and see if I can get Wayland working.
 
Right, I performed a fresh net install with the latest updates applied and everything was fine. When I installed the codecs from Packman my system broke. VLC complained about a pre-installed version especially.
 
When I played the mod or even the 2012 Steam version of the black mesa, we were getting around 200-400 FPS on most parts of the game, and it dips to only 80-100fps even on some of those heavy spots. These results were from Intel 4700K 16GB ram and GTX780 / GTX 1080.
 
Here are some of the very first screenshots/videos shared on internal forums with announcement post/patch for NewRenderer (the internal name for a part of engine upgrades that would eventually become XenEngine).
 
Depending on quality settings, we use two shadow map atlases with resolutions 2k/4k/8k. We use one main Shadowmap atlas and one for caching shadows from static/stationary (Brushes/Disps/props/NPCs) world geometry for static/stationary Lights.

We use from 1-tap to 9-tap filters depending on graphics quality settings. We also have 16 taps rotated poison disks and PCCS filters behind developer convars; they never got finalized because I never got the chance to get back to it to fix the last remaining bugs and polish.
 
For a long time during development, we were using a Box for spotlights with a radius equal to the range of the spotlight. Needless to say, it was horrible and did hurt perf in some cases but still not a significant hit in old levels.
 
We have two light entities, newlight\_pointlight and newlight\_spot. Here there screenshots from Hammer (map editor). We have many options, everything people expect nowadays from the newer Engine like Unreal, all in our good old source engine.
 

Static/Stationary/Dynamic mostly depends on shadowed lights because we upload light data for lights every frame. The ability to shut down specific faces of point lights shadow maps was also an essential feature, given the limited amount of shadow maps. Each point light takes 6 shadow maps which can fill quite fast.
 

We have a limit of 512 point light entities and 256 spotlights for light entities placed in the map editor. We also have a separate limit of 256 for each point and spot code light. Code lights are temp ( or permanent) light generated from code for FX like muzzle flash etc, or attached to prop/NPCs. But they all share the shared limit of 144 Shadow maps, as explained above. Based on our testing rendering, lights without shadows were mainly free or had negligible hit on frames render time on any GPU tested GTX 1080 or above for resolution up to 1440p.
 
I would also note that even with a VM running fedora on a fedora hosted machine it seems not possible to use true graphics acceleration unless there is an extra GPU installed that can be directly passed into the VM so that the OS of the VM is using its own drivers to manage the hardware acceleration.
 
I would not know what may have been changed with your update, you would need to check what packages were changed, but I would suspect that this is related to interaction between the kernel drivers and the graphics of both VMware and VirtualBox. Was windows updated at about the same time?
 
I just tried downgrading mesa from 23.3.2-7 to 23.2.1-2 and accelerated 3D works fine in VMPlayer with this version of mesa. I suspect that some change in mesa is out of sync with the part of open-vm-tools that provides accelerated 3D support.
