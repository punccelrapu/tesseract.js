Hello, I have a rather old HP Pavilion laptop running windows 10 64 bit. I'm wondering how difficult it is to replace the existing hard drive with an SSD close to the same size. Is it worth it? thanks in advance for your help
 
So, what you need is a 2.5" SATA3 SSD of your preferred brand and capacity. A the moment you have a 1TB drive. You could go with 500GB one and buy a housing for the old drive to use as an external USB drive, Well, any size you need. The Samsung ones are considered the best

I guess that is basically it. You will notifce the difference in performance. You do not need a product key, it will automatically activate once installed and connected to internet. It should boot from USB drive automatically once you have replaced the drive and turn on the PC.
 
I'm trying to upgrade the hard drive and memory in my Pavilion G6 (g6-1d71nr) laptop. It has a Hitachi 640GB HDD (SATA 3.0Gb/s) 5400RPM and 4GB of RAM. I gave up on trying to purchase a new laptop with an internal optical drive because I was having a hard time finding anything brand new. I'm not thrilled about an external optical drive and rather upgrade this laptop. I can find information stating that this laptop can handle up to 8GB of RAM but can't find any information regarding the hard drive. Any information on what hard drive this laptop can handle (maximum size and type, SSD, HDD etc..) will be appreciated.
 
You can upgrade to 2.5" SATA SSD - same size (capacity) or larger. The only problem is your machine is running SATA 3.0Gb/s which is SATA 2. Current 2.5" SSD drives are for SATA 3 (SATA 6.0Gb/s) therefore you won't get full benefit of better hard drive.
 
Thank you for your reply. I opened the back panel on my laptop and took a picture of the HDD's label. That is where I found that it is a Hitachi with a capacity of 640GB (500GB usable) along the SATA 3.0Gb/s and the 5400RPM. The model number I believe is "HDD: 5K750-640". I'm still leaning on getting a new 2TB or 4TB SSD hard drive to replace this one if I can confirm that this laptop can handle it. As far as the RAM, my only option is adding a second 4GB card since my max RAM is 8GB.
 
I'm not sure if this is helpful but I haven't upgraded anything in this laptop other than upgrading Windows from 7 to 10. As I understand it, a solid-state drive is better than a "spinning" HDD drive. I'd rather spend a little more for the SSD, assuming my laptop can handle it, even if I can't get 100 percent of the benefits.
 
You can go here Crucial Memory Upgrades and look up compatible ram for your laptop.

Alternatively, Windows users can determine the maximum RAM capacity in the Command prompt (Run as Administer) with the command here- "wmic memphysical get MaxCapacity" without the quotes and divide the value by 1024 That will give you the total amount supported by your laptop.

4 TB is the largest 2.5 inch SATA disk you are going to find on the market and you could use one of them. The actual specs of your model do not mention a hard drive or 2.5 INCH ssd. If you have a mechanical spinning hard drive I strongly recommend you upgrade to a 2.5 inch SATA SSD, which will mount and attach using the same hardware.
 
3D drive guard is only needed on a mechanical hard drive as it sends a command which parks the read head if the laptop falls. Not needed with an SSD but the app will work with a spinning hard drive as long as the driver is installed on the laptop.
 
in regards to the HDD, I could find many of them (on websites like amazon & ebay) which comes in huge capacity like 5tb (sometimes more), but I'm really worried if it will effect the performance.......
 
This one has only an NVME M.2 SSD. It has a space for a 2.5 inch SATA SSD or hard drive. However, if the laptop does not come with the 2.5 drive option installed the mounting and connecting hardware will not be included. If you see 5 TB sizes, you are likely looking up 3.5 inch desktop hard drives or server type 15 mm thick 2.5 inch drives which will not work in a laptop. They are made for blade servers. 7mm is laptop size thickness or maybe 9.5 mm. No thicker.
 
4 TB is the largest capacity 2.5 inch disk (HDD or SSD) you can put in a laptop and those are rare. 2 TB is the largest you can find in regular retail channels, usually. A larger capacity disk will not slow anything down. Not sure where you got that idea. A 2 TB drive has the same input and output speed as a half TB disk of the same spin speed or not enough difference to really make a difference.
 
**PITA WARNING: THIS LAPTOP IS A MAJOR PITA TO WORK ON DUE TO THE AMOUNT OF DISASSEMBLY REQUIRED TO ACCESS THE HARD DRIVE. Plan on spending a lot of time sorting screws, and taking multiple parts off (which would not have been an issue if the laptop was designed with repair in mind). If you break the palmrest in a way requiring replacement, this will be a very expensive mistake! Take your time and know your skills before opening this laptop!**
**AUTHOR'S NOTE (added for transparency): Personally, I do not consider this a difficult repair; however, I know how to make these awful machines more workable to open for beginners.**
 
If the hard drive in your system has failed or you just want to replace the existing drive in your system with an SSD or larger spinning drive, this guide will show you how to access the hard drive for replacement.
 
I just recently bought this computer and wanted to know if you are able to upgrade the hard drive to a SSD. Mine came with the a 1 TB 5400 RPM HDD but i wanted to put in a new SSD to increase performance.
 
If you still want to do the upgrade it is possible to install either a SATA M.2 2280 disk or a PCIe/NVME. GIve a choice you want a PCIe/NVME since they are the fastest thing out there. Up to 5 times as fast as a SATA M.2.
 
I have an HP Pavilion dv6500 entertainment laptop, Intel centrino duo processor and 2GB Ram running on Vista. The original 160 Gbt SATA HD is getting full and slow and I would like to upgrade to a new HD. I am thinking of getting a Seagate 1TB 2.5 inch Laptop Solid State Hybrid Drive. Will this fit and will it work without any issues on this laptop? Is this a recommended option?
 
This is the procedure I followed. I configured the bios to boot from a usb. Then I booted up the laptop from a backup programme\* from the usb and backed up an image of the entire system to an external portable hard drive. Then I removed the old hard drive and removed the special multi pin adapter and attached it to the new 1TB Hybrid HD before inserting it. Then I booted up from the USB and restored the computer system image to the new HD. Then I shut down, reset the bios to defaults and booted up Windows Vista Home for the first time with the new HD. It tookquite a while for Windows to load for the first time with the new HD because it had to adjust to the new hardware. After that it booted up normally.
 
I would like to mention that Windows update stopped working after installing the new HD. I got the error message. Windows Update Cannot Check For Updates, Because The Service Is Not Running. I ran the Windows Update automatic fix but this did not solve the problem for me.
 
I got my dv600 to work fine with a 1TB Seagate hybrid drive. Please follow the above steps in the previous posts. Clone your drive to the new drive. There are various free programes you can use to do this.
 
Another option to consider if you don't need 1TB of space is instaling a 240Tbt or a 450 Tbt ssd drive which will work faster. SSD drives have the advantage that the page file ram will also work faster from the SSD compared to a regular HD. This is useful because this machine can only have 2TBt of physical ram.

According to the user manual, HP Pavilion only has one M. 2 slot for an SSD and no option to add an extra 2.5" SSD. You can refer to the user manual, chapter 5, page 32, where the single M. 2 SSD is located to the left of the battery.
 
To check if SSD is compatible with your HP laptop, you need to figure out the interface type of hard disk in your laptop first(SATA or PCIe). Physical size is also important, so you need to check your laptop's specifications or consult the manufacturer's website to de
