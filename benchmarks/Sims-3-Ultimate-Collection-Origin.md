I tried to register the game in my Origin Account, and as I imagined, the serial was not valid. So I started a chat in US Origin (I'm brazilian) and asked for help to register the game in my account.

In the begining I thought I would be successfull in this process, until the moment when the clerk said that the registration wouldn't be possible because the game is very old. I answered saying that Origin owns**older** **games than** The Sims 1 (SimCity 2000, Theme Hospital...), and the clerk was unable to explain the availablity of these games.

So then, I started observing my game and I realized that it was produced in 2008. I notified the clerk about this, about Sims 2 also. I got lots of criteria about the fact that "The Sims Complete Collection is too old", until the clerk guided me to create a topic in Origin forum about this question to call attention of the developers. Instantly I looked for it to find answers about my issue.

After I searched topics in forum, I thought about what the clerk has told me "all attention of the developers" e asked him about it. He said that a post in the forum could convince (or not) the developers to provide The Sims 1 in Origin.

He also offered me The Sims 2 Ultimate Collection (I already own this one), saying that it was better than TS1. I thought a little disrispect, once my first question was about how to register The Sims Complete Collection in my account.

After 3 hours chatting trying to understand why the game will not be available on Origin to date, I concluded what was mentioned at the beginning of the publication.

Since now... I'm a big fan of The Sims series and I am **REALLY** disapointed about the way EA treats this classic game that gave birth to everything we have today.

Hi this is the true EA they dont care of the fans to the big game titles ehy only care about money. I not fan of EA as company but they had made some create game but they dont care about the users the buyers.
 
@luvspsyche , as long as you have the CDs/DVDs of the any version of The Sims or Sims 2 and a disk drive, you have play the game. EA no longer sells the games, but does provide support in getting these games to work with the help of other players like you.
 
@luvspsyche , if you are running Windows 10 as your OS (Operating System), there are some additional steps you will need to take to get Sims 2 to install. Search YouTube for Sims 2 installation on Windows 10 and you will find several good step by step videos to help you.
 
@vctrmsqt , EA made the decision to sunset the Sims 2 Ultimate Collection in October 2018. -The-Sims-Games/Ending-code-support-for-The-Sims-2-Ultimate-Collectio.... I am simply passing along information for other players who may or may not know this information and helping people to install and run their games. Or troubleshoot issues.

I always make sure to advise people that both The Sims (original game) and The Sims 2 are only available for purchase in CD/DVD form and that to play the game requires an external disk drive which aren't that expensive in the long run. You can still find copies on Amazon, E-Bay, your local game store that sells used copies of the game and thrift stores. I do not advocate nor does EA pirating the game. Even if it a sunset game. And you can (once you install the game) create a disk image on your computer to play the game without lugging around the disk drive.
 
EA is aware of the Community wanting both the original and Sims 2 to be remastered and made digital on Origin. Not only myself, but the Community Managers who oversee all the forums here on AHQ and the Official Forums have passed on the concerns of the players to the Devs who are the ones who make the decisions. There are hundreds if not thousands of posts both here and on the Official Forums asking for the game to be digital.
 
I'm afraid we will have to agree to disagree as they say. You can purchase the external disk drive or not. That is your choice. That is the easiest and best solution at this time if you want to play the game.
 
To be honest, it is a lot more complicated than just reposting the game on Origin. To remaster the game (which is over 20 years old at this point), requires the devs to review the code, look at how Windows operates today as opposed to 20 years ago, see what has changed to get the game to run properly in Windows 10, and to update information on newer processors, video cards and other computer components which the game accesses. It requires a lot of time, money and effort to remaster a 20 year old game and EA has chosen to spend their manpower and resources elsewhere. If you'd like to see how complicated a remaster of an older game is, I suggest reading this post in the Mac section about the remaster of Sims 3 for the Mac. -Issues-Mac/the-sims-3-64-bit-amp-metal-release/td-p/8631090. With Covid-19 and having to work from home, it has become very difficult for many games (not only from EA) to meet original deadlines.
 
As Windows, and the hardware it runs on, has changed over time since the original launch of many of our games, unfortunately older games won't always run properly for you in compatibility mode under Windows 10, but it's worth trying!
 
i am old and definitely electronically challenged! My eight year old granddaughter knows more than me about electronics! I just got back online after a 6 year absence from it! I still have windows 7 on my computer that I purchased in 2010 from Walmart just before i retired! I'm sure i have old drivers that need to be upgraded or what ever you do to them! the launcher started acting up after i tried to download becks animated farm horse, as mine was not working right! Now it will not launch at all and has all kinds of writing about sims on it as well! Help me please I want to play my sims!
 
@gramsharri , welcome back. Yes, you should update Windows 7, but do not update to Windows 10. So what exactly is the game doing? Is it launching? Or was it starting before you added the Farm Horse? Just trying to figure out what's going on so I can give you the right instructions.
 
It has a lot of writing on my launcher that it didn't have before i downloaded the farm horse! I finally got it to launch after i hit the remove script button several times! The farm horse works better at least they can ride but they can not brush or clean so something didn't get down loaded right! I would like to at least remove all the script on my launcher!? It's all about sims 4 & I only have many ( like 14 sims 2 games)! can't afford to go with other sims games! I am very happy with my sims 2 games! I have many custom downloads from mod the sims on my game! Are there any other sims 2 sites still available?
 
@AbC5595a3631899 , you'd have to find out what make and model your Graphics card is and check the manufacturer's website for updated drivers. Once you download it, you'd need to follow the instructions from the site on how to install them.
 
I had this issue exactly a month ago, and it took me uninstalling and reinstalling 4 separate times and repairing my sims collection 3 times to get it functional and fully installed again. I've been a loyal player since 2000, but the last few months at least have just been terrible.
 
I tried to open the launcher, and it says that I do not have the launcher installed (I use the EA app and have been for a while, not Origin. Someone needs to check their code). I tried to open the game directly and it says that the shortcut has been changed or moved, despite me not touching it and no one else having access to my laptop. To reinstall several times and repair several times took about 10 hours last month; I am not willing to do this every month to play a game when I only have a few hours a week to sit down and enjoy them. How else do I fix this?
 
EA quality control has absolutely gone down the toilet over the last few years, please get this under control before you lose all of your loyal, long-term players. I really love Sims and it's one of my go-to's, I would hate to have to cut it out over EA's cash-over-quality policies.
 
Please see the attachment for error messages. One is what happens when I try to open the EA app, one is what happens with the game directly. I cannot open them from my menu either, everything is corrupted. I do not use any mods or CC, this is just game and expansions purchased directly from EA. The last fix I did took 3 days and finished on 6/20/24; I had a week and a half to play before life got hectic again and I was looking forward to playing today but came back to this again. It seems to line up with big updates since the latest expansion should be coming out soon, or already did come out. Laptop stats:
 
Recently a Patron of mine was having trouble getting the 4GB patch to apply. We tried literally everything I could think of and her memory would not change in the Config Log. I have had several comments and emails about this too.
 
Drag the .exe file from your TS Bin to your desktop and apply the 4GB patch there. Check your log file to make sure it applied. Your memory should be updated. Then you can use the shortcut you just created on your desktop to play the game.
 
If you have the disc version of the game, it might be necessary to move the .exe file to another folder. I have no idea why this is necessary for some computers and not others. If nothing else works, try this!
 
Today I saw an older post mentioning Securom and even though the Origin Ultimate collection supposedly has it removed I decided to try the Removal Tool and though it said no Securom elements were detected I ran it anyway & n
