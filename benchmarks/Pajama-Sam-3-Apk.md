Our national network of volunteers, local Chapter Presidents, and Community Partners provides tens of thousands of pajamas and books for children across the United States, including Puerto Rico, each year.
 
Pajama short sets are the perfect combination of comfort and style for any season and every sleeper. These cute pajama sets come in a variety of designs and colors, making it easy to find just the right set to suit your personal taste. Crafted from soft, comfortable fabrics like cotton, modal, satin, and more, pajama short sets are the obvious choice for lounging, sleeping, and everything in between.
 
Angel Heart Pajama Project was born from a simple yet profound idea: that every child deserves to feel safe, warm, and loved, especially at bedtime. Founded by a group of compassionate individuals who recognized the need for basic comforts among children facing adversity, our organization quickly grew from a grassroots effort to a beacon of hope for countless families.
 
Driven by our core belief in the power of kindness and generosity, we set out to make a tangible difference in the lives of children across our community. We understand that for many of these children, pajamas aren't just clothing; they're a source of security, dignity, and comfort in the face of uncertainty.
 
At Angel Heart Pajama Project, our mission is twofold: to provide children in need with the warmth and comfort of new pajamas, and to instill in them a sense of worthiness and belonging. We believe that every child deserves to go to bed feeling safe and cared for, regardless of their circumstances.

Through our tireless efforts and the support of our dedicated volunteers and generous donors, we work to ensure that no child goes to sleep without the comfort of cozy pajamas. Whether they're staying in shelters, foster homes, or struggling families, we strive to reach every child who needs us, bringing them a sense of warmth and security that extends far beyond the fabric of their pajamas.
 
Angel Heart Pajama Project's impact extends beyond the tangible gift of pajamas. We understand that our work is about more than just providing clothing; it's about showing children that they are valued, that they are seen, and that they are deserving of love and comfort.
 
Since our founding, Angel Heart Pajama Project has touched the lives of thousands of children in our community. We've seen firsthand the difference that a new pair of pajamas can make in a child's life, from the smile on their face when they receive them to the sense of comfort and security they provide each night at bedtime.
 
But our work is far from over. There are still countless children in our community who need our support, and with your help, we can continue to make a difference in their lives. Together, we can ensure that every child goes to sleep feeling safe, warm, and loved.
 
Thank you for visiting Angel Heart Pajama Project. Whether you choose to donate, volunteer, or simply spread the word about our cause, you are helping us bring comfort and joy to children in need. Together, we can make bedtime a little brighter for every child.
 
While it's not a necessity, dogs can benefit from wearing pajamas for various reasons. Firstly, pajamas keep dogs warm and cozy, especially during the winter season. Secondly, pajamas can help minimize shedding, preventing your home from becoming a fur-filled mess. Additionally, let's not forget how adorable dogs look in their cute pajamas, especially when they match with their humans. Whether it's a Pitbull, French Bulldog, big dog, or even a playful puppy, consider getting them pajamas for added comfort and style.
 
The best pajamas for dogs, including Pitbulls, French Bulldogs, big dogs, and puppies, have a few key features. Firstly, a perfect fit, especially around the hind legs, ensures comfort and freedom of movement. Look for pajamas made from flexible and soft fabric that doesn't restrict their natural mobility. Additionally, opt for pajamas that wash well and retain their color, maintaining their quality over time. With these features, your furry friend will have cozy and stylish pajamas to keep them comfortable during bedtime or lounging around.
 
To measure your dog for a cozy pajama, start by getting their neck girth, chest girth, and back length. Wrap a tape measure around their neck where a collar would sit, ensuring a comfortable fit. Repeat the process around the widest part of their chest using the two-finger rule. Measure from the base of the neck to the start of the tail for the back length. If your furry companion is a Pitbull, French Bulldog, big dog, or a playful puppy, remember to choose a size that accommodates their breed's unique proportions. With the right measurements, your dog will be snug and stylish in their new pajama!

The twin stroller violates multiple safety regulations for strollers. The front seat in the forward-facing configuration poses an entrapment hazard to children. In addition, failures with the restraint system and rear seat enclosure pose a fall hazard to children. In products with a black grab bar, the foam padding on the grab bar can pose a choking hazard if the child bites it.

Today starts one of my \*favorite\* sales of the year, the Lake Pajama sale! I have so many cozy Lake pieces that I wear on repeat, so I love grabbing a few new pieces on super sale. Truth be told, as soon as I get home I put on a pair of Lake, the lounge sets are pure perfection for all the after work hours!
 
For Lake pajama sizing for kids, I size up at least two sizes! Laurens is currently wearing a size 2T in regular clothes so I have been ordering him a 4T in Lake pjs for the last few months, but my next order will be 5T for sure.
 
For Laurens, I love both the short sets and the long sets. They are so cozy and wear really well! I do think the kid pajamas are a great buy for an Easter Basket filler, and also to get a jump start on Christmas pjs for next season! These prices are the lowest they will be all year.
 
For me, I love the robes, which I have one of each of their styles and they are all SO good! This one is pure sunshine and I do find myself grabbing this blue floral one the most. Love this pretty one, too. Also, I prefer their relaxed weekend style pjs (this kimono style I love!) to all the other ones, but that is mostly because of the relaxed fit. Again, I am team COMFY.
 
**Check-in:** Please arrive at 5:30pm on Friday, August 2 to begin your Teddy Bear adventure! Bringing along a stuffed animal and wearing your favorite pair of cozy pajamas is highly encouraged.
 
Our 0-20 size range is based on a B cup bust with an average height of 5'-6". Please note that B cup does not refer to bra sizing, but rather the difference in inches between high and full bust. A 2" difference between those measurements is equivalent to a B cup (a difference of 1"= A cup, 2" = B cup, 3" = C cup etc.) If the difference between your high bust and full bust is higher than 2", you may need to make a full bust adjustment for select patterns.
 
Our 14-32 size range is based on a D cup bust and pear-shaped lower body with an average height of 5'-6". Please note that D cup does not refer to bra sizing, but rather the difference in inches between high and full bust; a 4" difference between those measurements is equivalent to a D cup (a difference of 1"= A cup, 2" = B cup, 3" = C cup etc.).
