Please do not use Internet Explorer 9 for the upgrade.
 
Use the 8180 Web Interface Control Panel to reboot your device, go to System > Maintenance and select Reboot. Wait 30 to 60 seconds for the interface to reload. Download the files listed below to your PC, making sure to observe which ones are for the Kernel, and which ones are for the Firmware. Note: file names must remain unchanged.

Here are instructions and download links for installing **Peachtree Audio 24/192 USB audio drivers** for Windows 10, Windows 8 and Windows 7. These drivers should be installed before streaming audio via your Windows PC's USB connection to the llisted Peachtree components **ONLY**.
 
According to the arch wiki, one should install the Sound Open Firmware. Is there an example on howto install such a firmware on nixos or can I just simply create a derivation that downloads the release and copies the files?
 
I tried every solution in this post, but sound on my X1 Carbon Gen 7 never works. This is a new laptop, and it worked in the beginning - but somewhere along the upgrades (probably after fwupdmgr updates) it stopped working.
 
Any source that requires decoding (e.g compressed streams from the Internet, AirPlay, etc.) will require processing by the firmware. If any changes are made to the decoding algorithms then it could have an effect on the sound quality.

There is no machine learning in the normal sense in the Naim streamers. But yes the firmware code is optimised for best sound performance/balance as determined by Naim before it is released.
Usually beta releases are not optimised, and so there can be an audible shift between beta and release firmware with the latter being optimised.
The code execution sound performance optimisation is undertaken for each device, as the electronics and digital underlay varies between models.
 
As far as noise, when digital logic gates are operated, such as in buffers, CPU, shift registers and memory small amounts of electro magnetic noise pulses are created. This is natural physics due to the rapid change of states. When aggregated up over a digital system this creates a sequence of noise bursts, almost like a rhythm, as if you were shaking out a rhythm with some maracas. (But extremely quickly). By undertaking certain machine operations at precise times, the induced rhythm of noise, or shaped noise can be optimised to interact with the audio and clocking subsystems in a way that modulates any induced artefacts to act, as as I have been told by Naim, to almost act as tone controls.
 
I imagine it must be frustrating for developers and Naim not to have full control over dsp such that every update produce predicable, identical sound signature. Especially when users have very sharp hearing.
 
NOTE 1: The FM9 supports DynaCab speaker simulation, introduced in firmware 5.0. If you are upgrading from firmware 4.x or older, you will also need to install the DynaCabs update. If you already installed the DynaCabs update with 5.0 or newer you do NOT need to reinstall it as there have been no changes. If you see a message about DynaCabs not installed, please see this article: [1]
 
Cygnus X-3 is the latest amp modeling technology for Axe-Fx III, FM9, and FM3. It improves the sound, feel, and accuracy of our amp models, making them closer to their real world counterparts, with more rumble and bite and other nasty things that tube amps do.
 
IMPORTANT: 4.01 adds several features that expand the System Settings memory storage size. These settings cover the Global, I/O, MIDI/Remote, Tuner, and Foot Controller sections. As a result, System Settings created using firmware version 4.01 are not backward-compatible with earlier firmware versions. To restore System Settings after reverting for any reason to firmware older than 4.01, use a backup file created previously under the older firmware to restore System Settings.
 
\*It is **absolutely critical**to use FAT32 and 32kB cluster/allocation unit size. If you're having trouble installing firmware, wipe and reformat the SDcard with these parameters. Hidden files and directories will bork the install as well. Again. Wipe. Reformat. FAT32. 32kB cluster. Turn off Bifrost. Plug SDcard in. Label up. Push all the way in. Turn on Bifrost 2. Watch light show. Remove card. Happy life.
 
Hi: sorry to say no audio. Will you consider the option to send me HP Firmware 15.36.0.0 ? After the 10-27-22 move to 15.37.0.0 the OMEN did not have a fall back option. I would like to try to install 15.36.0.0. Best regards

Out of the blue, we began experiencing the issue described at Sangoma phones require a weekly reboot - phones would just start behaving like they had a process running away, consuming 100% of their CPU time. It only affected the s500 & s705 phones, which were both running the .72 firmware.
 
Simply create a script with as many of those lines as you need and create a cron job to run the script a couple of hours before the users arrive for work; the phone will have a fresh boot and not have the laggy / sluggish performance.
 
As a very general rule, if you have bugs or technical issues with paid products, the support is included in the purchase price. If you are seeking assistance with config, or setup or want bug support for free products, then credits are required.
 
The only deviation from the norm was that I was working remote for just shy of 3 weeks and my desk phone sat idle that entire length of time. When I returned, I noticed it would take literally 2-3 seconds to acknowledge key presses. A reboot of the phone fixed it, but then I heard our operators (whose phones had not sat for any appreciable length of time) were experiencing the same type of thing. No clue how/why my s705 sitting idle would affect their s500 phones, but they never experienced it in the time prior; IIRC, .72 was applied to their phones shortly after it was released. The timing might just be a coincidence, though the older I get the less I believe in coincidences like this. This is when I updated the firmware to .82, downgraded to .78 due to call quality problems, then downgraded again to the .72 they had been running on & wrote a script to reboot the operator phones nightly to avoid the slowdown issue. No changes or updates have been made to the system since well before the slowdown apart from changing the names on extensions & resetting VM passwords when people change.
