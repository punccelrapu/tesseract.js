The "Save to Evernote" function on the new MailButler doesn't work for me - it stopped working some months ago - it was the main feature I had purchased mailbutler. I am windering if anybody else is experiencing this and if you know of a work around solution: is the problem related to a change on Evernote or is it just a poor job by MailButler?
 
Thanks for the input which actually got me to solve the problem - at least in part, the additional plugin (which I had) suddenly stopped working one day. When I approached Mailbutler support, they told me it was their problem so I didn't even try to solve... today I played with the configuration and it's working again... This kind of integration with important platforms such as Mail for Mac could be an integration Evernote could offer directly IMO - I find the integration with Mail priceless, an incredible added value

Just tried using it and if there is a conversation chain it ignores every email in the conversation except for the very last one. The clipper is more useful in this regard. If possible there should be an option in a chain to choose which emails to save
 
@Jim Finn You can do that now. After opening the Evernote GMail addon, Click on the "..." menu next to the "X" and select "Settings". Then, enable "Show messages in thread". Click "Apply Changes." Then click the left arrow to go back to the previous screen. You should now see an entry for "Conversation" and should say "1 of X messages." Click "Edit" and select what messages you would like to clip in the conversation and click "Apply changes". This should then clip all the selected messages to the note.
 
I followed-up with the dev team and here's what they told me: In general, clipping multiple emails in a thread is a bad experience. This is due to each message in a thread often contains all previous entries in the thread as well (due to email clients defaulting to "quoting" the previous email). So clipping multiple messages just ends up with lots of duplication in the Evernote note. Also, it quickly balloons the size of the resulting note, which slows down the save, making for a bad experience for our users. So ultimately, they decided to not show the option by default, but allow it to be discovered and enabled for those seeking the option.
 
The add-on appeared to install, and is listed in the Gmail-Settings-Addons page, but there is no icon showing on the mail page(s). I have followed one comment suggestion that I close and restart the browser, but still no change.
 
Here is a user who has paid for Evernote's most expensive plan since 2009, with thousands of notes, and who has experienced several bad decisions by this company at different stages and who, despite the self-inflicted sabotage of its developers, has stuck with it.

Any progress on your request mi\_cha? I'm having the same/a similar issue. Every time I try to reconnect my EN with gmail so I can clip emails I get:

"Missing required oauth parameter "oauth\_token"" 

This has been ongoing for a while. Thankfully my need isn't near as pressing as yours.
 
My colleagues and I are migrating our workflow to a set of other tools. Emails (now saved as pdf) and all other pdfs are no longer saved in Evernote, and we are exporting existing attachments to a cloud service. We hope to be able to leave Evernote completely by Jan25.
 
After the new developments (?!) that are clearly downgrading the mobile experience (we do more than creating shopping lists on the go), we finally got the message that the new owners have other plans for Evernote and we just don't fit anymore.
 
When clicking on the "Authorize" button on the Evernote for Gmail addon within Gmail, a pop-up window opens to do the actual authorization. During a very brief moment (matter of couple of seconds), the addon itself (on the right of Gmail, not the new pop-up window) is still in mode "waiting"/"thinking" (you see some dynamic action on the frame). After a while, that "dynamic" action stops and the addon is in a more static state.
 
If you click the Authorize button on the pop-up window once the addon (on the right of GMail) has stopped, then you have the error: Token Mismatch (I guess the dynamic frame is kinda showing some timeout that, once passed (hence the dynamic action stops), the Evernote addon cancels the token on its side).
 
Well, if you are able to be the fastest "clicker" in the old wild western of internet... and click on Authorize (on the po-up window) before that dynamic action on the add-on frame stops, the authorization seems to be succesful. At least it worked on my side.
 
Your workaround has worked!!! I've tried it right now and everything ran as you described. Somehow I managed to click all the buttons super fast and yes, the addon is active, duly authorized, but - as you pointed out - veeeery slow. Ok, I can live with that for the time being, hope it improves someday.
 
One of my main workflows in EN consisted of saving emails (+-150/day now) and tagging them. I have a LOT of saved searches (multiple criteria) and these saved searches build dossiers automatically, which I analyze on a daily/weekly basis. Either I take action myself, or I send it to my colleagues and monitor their work (most of time). The "description" of the case is my job, that's why it is so important to save the email with the addon. Forwarding is not a good solution, because my personal evernote email would be part of the "digital document" (the original email, which is legal proof). Copying/pasting is also terrible, because EN pastes the email as a table, and I spend a lot of time extracting the text and formatting it later on Word. The addon gave me exactly what I needed: searchable text ready to copy/paste and reuse elsewhere.
 
I really don't know any app which could replace EN for my worflow: nested tags + advanced seach syntax + saved searches + web clipper + gmail addon. Other PKM tools don't have these features and look quite inconsistent.
 
I know that my user profile is no longer a priority to the owners, as we have clearly seen after the changes in mobile. Notes become less important than tasks and calendars. They have other aims, and they are in their right to do so. But no, they can't leave support tickets of paying users unanswered for months. I am not asking for anything new, I just want something which has worked before and is currently available in the service to work again.
 
In case EN kills any of the core functions which are essential for me and I have to adapt elsewhere, I don't intend to commit to any other note-taking app like I did years ago to EN. I would have a less automated system, I would probably be less productive, of course, but I would have more control over my information and workflow (as primitive as it might sound):
 
- thanks - great workaround (if a little bizarre). In my case, had to try a few times before it took -- guess it may be related to the slowness -- it is very slow in actual use -- but maybe it's timing out during the authentication process?
 
I just created a plugin to allow users coming from Evernote to Joplin to be able to replace internal links in Evernote format to Joplin format (it's not done by default in the migration process when importing .enex files in Joplin).
 
This is a great tool. The only problem is that I migrated my entire 7000 note Evernote universe to Joplin nine months ago. So I now have many Evernote cross links embedded in my Joplin notes.
Is there anyway that you can see to run a batch operation on my desktop Win 10 Joplin installation?
 
If I'm understanding this correctly, if one has finished importing all enex files and subsequently closed, then opened Joplin (allowing this plugin to run), there is no need to continue to keep the plugin installed?
 
Without looking into the plugin too deeply, and going off memory as I looked into this link preservation issue a few years ago when I started moving notes to Joplin, I assume what your plugin is doing is looking at the note title text in the note link url and searching for a note with that title and creating the link (i.e., it assumes the target note's title has not changed since the link url was created in Evernote)?
 
How to Use
Install the plugin via Joplin's Plugin Manager. Once installed and activated, navigate to Tools > Replace Evernote Links. The plugin will go through all notes and make the necessary replacements.
 
That's when I realized it had started out on its own after installing and restarting Joplin.
Not knowing he was working, I had to leave Joplin at one point and then I started him again. I hope this didn't disrupt the plugin's work.
