John started working at WTOP in 2016 after having grown up in Maryland listening to the station as a child. While he got his on-air start at small stations in Pennsylvania and Delaware, he's spent most of his career in the D.C. area, having been heard on several local stations before coming to WTOP.
 
Our simulators feature 180-degree vision with three 4k LED screens. By surrounding drivers with these screens, they feel more like they're behind the wheel instead of just facing forward with a single screen.

Even though driving simulators are used for training, they provide the most realistic experience you can get without getting behind the wheel. You can change the time of the day, weather conditions, road type, geographical environment, and even vehicle type.
 
Our advanced driver training feedback tools prevent your employees from failing the same scenario over and over again. With the simulator's playback capability, you can instruct your employees on the moment they made a mistake and how that affected everything following it.
 
Learning by doing in a safe and controlled environment is the best way to train new drivers. Your drivers get an immersive experience that allows them to make mistakes without real-world consequences. Meanwhile, your fleet is on the road, making you money.
 
Around Barcelona, there are a number of monuments and points of interest that players can visit and document. Every now and again, fares will make conversation with you, and knowledge of these places can help direct the conversation in an interesting and enjoyable direction, increasing potential tips and making the drive more pleasant. It adds a unique incentive to driving around the city, getting to know the streets and improving your skills.

In our first practice session on the actual Nurburgring a month before our first qualifying race for the 24-hours, all drivers were able to drive at around 93 to 94% of their best time on only their second practice lap and post sub-10 minute lap times. The level of realism and accuracy built into Gran Turismo allowed us to reach near peak performance quicker and in a controlled and far safer atmosphere.
 
In addition to lots of advanced driver training at other facilities, all members will be required to master the track on the simulator prior to pushing their own cars to the limit when the real Magarigawa opens in late 2022.
 
Portobello, a new driving simulator developed by researchers at Cornell Tech, blends virtual and mixed realities, enabling both drivers and passengers to see virtual objects overlaid in the real world.
 
This posed a significant obstacle to conducting meaningful studies, particularly for autonomous driving experiments that require precise staging of objects and events in fixed locations within the environment.
 
Portobello was conceived to overcome these limitations and anchor on-road driving simulations in the physical world. During the design phase, researchers utilize the Portobello system to generate a precise map of the study environment. Within this map, they can strategically position virtual objects based on real-world elements (placing virtual pedestrians near stop signs, for example). The vehicle operates within the same mapped environment, seamlessly blending simulation and reality.
 
With the successful integration of Portobello, the team has not only addressed the limitations of XR-OOM but has also introduced platform portability. This innovation enables researchers to conduct identical studies in both controlled laboratory settings and real-world driving scenarios, enhancing the precision and applicability of their findings.
 
The driving itself feels good, with a couple of caveats. For some ungodly reason, the only way to keep your car from rolling forwards or backwards while stopped at a traffic light or stop sign is to alternate light taps of the left and right triggers. Because holding the left trigger will make you go in reverse, this was the only way to keep from rolling into another vehicle without engaging the parking brake at every stop. It drove me bonkers. The other caveat is more of an adjustment, I suppose, than an issue, but Americans should come in prepared to learn the traffic patterns and street signage necessary to drive competently in Barcelona.
 
Jason has been writing for Gaming Nexus since 2022. Some of his favorite genres of games are strategy, management, city-builders, sports, RPGs, shooters, and simulators. His favorite game of all-time is Red Dead Redemption 2, logging nearly 1,000 hours in Rockstar's Wild West epic. Jason's first video game system was the NES, but the original PlayStation is his first true video game love affair. Once upon a time, he was the co-host of a PlayStation news podcast, as well as a basketball podcast.
 
Taxi Life puts the player in the shoes of a business owner starting a taxi company in Barcelona. The objective is to grow the company by completing fares, purchasing new vehicles, upgrading said vehicles, hiring drivers and sending them out to complete even more fares to eventually become the taxi king or queen of the city.
 
The driving mechanics (speeding or not) offer a decent experience, with some quirks like over-steer and delayed reactions to sharp turns. There are varied camera options including cockpit, dash and hood. It would have been nice to have more options for a third-person camera because the one offered is a little too close to the car.
 
Also, the perk tree is worth taking the time to study before investing perk points. Level-up options include boosting the speed at which XP is gained, greater availability of VIP Jobs that pay more money, lower costs for maintenance services like towing, mechanics and cleaning, and so forth. My personal favorite perk provides the ability for drivers I hire to cost my company less in terms of salary while raising their efficiency. These all add a layer of strategy to what might otherwise be a straightforward taxi experience.
 
Another issue for me was that while Taxi Life strives for realism, it falls short in some aspects. Believable vehicle damage adds to the immersion, but a lack of consequences for traffic violations feels unrealistic. Hitting pedestrians netted me a 100 Euro fine, which is a pittance considering the thousands I easily stacked up in the first few taxi fares I completed. One would expect a heavier hand with such serious infractions. Running a red light right in front of the police was particularly jarring as it does not net a fine of any kind.
 
Taxi Life ultimately offers a mixed bag by blending realism with a fantasy upgrade system. While the attention to detail and perk system impress, issues like the lack of expected consequences detract from the experience.
 
**Deaf & Hard of Hearing Gamers:** Taxi Life offers no options for audio accessibility other than subtitles. The game is playable without sound, as there are no necessary audio cues needed for play. Taxi Life is **fully accessible**.
 
The MATEX testing facility at LSU (Materials under Extreme Loadings) conducts impact damage in materials and structures using both the Split Hopkinson Bar and the high velocity Impact Tester. This facility helps researchers to characterize the material behavior of materials when subjected to impact loadings. The characterization focuses on the microstructural effects of materials and considering size effects on the macroscopic behavior of metals, polymers and rocks. This leads to better constitutive relations for the solution of physical problems due to impact loads. The MATEX laboratory houses extensive testing facilities in impact and damage for testing of metals and structures using the Hopkinson Bar equipment as well as the Impact Tester.
 
The driving simulator lab hosts the LSU Driving Simulator, a full-sized passenger car (Ford Fusion) combined with a series of cameras, projectors and screens to provide a high fidelity virtual environment that offers a high degree of driving realism. It provides a one degree of freedom motion simulation to make a driver experience similar driving efforts as in an instrumented vehicle. Its open architecture software tools allows for data collection during simulation experiments, and creation of new networks and virtually an infinite number of simulation scenarios. Vehicle simulation makes it possible for inexpensive alternatives and sometimes impossible (unethical or safety implications) field tests to be undertaken in the lab. Research conducted in the lab include safety in work zones, examining driving behavior of distracted drivers, testing driver reactions and performance under varying categories of hurricane winds, and development of a connected-vehicles simulation test-bed. The lab is also capable of examining the effects of different levels of task complexity on visual fixation strategies and visual stimulus recognition, determining the effect of road signage, road type and other factor
