The basic theory is that you need to open up the left side of the airbox to increase airflow and change the airpulse resonance (whatever.. as long as it works right?)

Doing the modification is easy and requires Allen / hex keys for the right side fairing and the air-snout/intake channel from the nose. A dremel or similar for cutting the air intake/snout and soldering iron for the left side mod plus a good flashlight.
 
RIGHT SIDE
Remove the curved hard plastic airchannel and cut with a Dremel cutting tool as shown. 
This part of the mod actually does little to increase power.
Only 1hp, but that HP is gained in an area where there is a dip in power and torque.
