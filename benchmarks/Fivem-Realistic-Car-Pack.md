Hello, my name is Shrike and I am here to give you a simple handling.meta that will make your life so much better when you have your AI traffic turned on! I know this really helps our Roleplay servers, especially when running Code 3. They actually pull to the side xD. This is not 100% perfect but I really does help.

GTA5-Mods.com GTA IV Handling Mod AI Traffic FixGTA IV Handling Mod AI Traffic Fix. This mod will work with ANY other traffic mod, all it does it make the NPC's AI more cautious behind the wheel Do you have a mod that makes all of the vehicles handle a bit more like they did in GTA IV? ...
 
Some tweaks to the AI handling to give the traffic a more realistic feel. The vanilla traffic is too safe and boring, other traffic tweaks cause too much chaos. So I decided to make mine. Traffic in the city is mostly similar to vanilla, but...
 
Sorry guys, it will be no longer available for singleplayer. Handling crash because I made a custom hadling.meta with mixed dlcs cars. As you know in OpenIV handlings are separated by dlcs and with a specific orders. You can replace manually code by code, but I dont recomendad that. Sorry so much.

@Taira does this add all the handling.meta files for the vanilla cars and I can adjust some as needed? I am trying to do exactly what you are doing for my fivem server, but was having trouble learning how to do it for the vanilla cars. So big thanks for that!
 
@FlawlessWhale Hi there, it will be so simple. At first you need to edit the archive handling.meta Check the "objects of cars" add a comment for separate cars. to create a comment put this line Here introduce your new car handling . If you want to add a car to the list. edit the list adding your new car. Simple at all :D
 
Doesnt work... I put it in my FiveM server, specifically filled out Ellie cuz it was not listed there, copied its handling from SP, modified max velocity, car still goes 108 mph instead of its IRL 160...
 
@Bumpy86 If you want to add a new car to the list. You need to copy the code content from the original handling.meta located in dlcs files, be sure that belong to Ellie. But, I think that Ellie share handling with another model. Im pretty sure of that.
 
@Taira You were wrong. Ellie has its own handling but unfortunatelly that car is broken by Rockstar with other 5 or 6 cars and no matter what you do, the car will behave poorly. The way I fixed that was to make a brand new car with a completely different name "Ellie Custom" and I went from there, tweaked the physics from ground up and now it works and the car aint shit no more and handles like it should...

my game only seems to crash when loading a new game or saved game, i can replay missions but it crashes when loading me back into freemode when the mission is finished, super awesome mod and works perfect in freemode i just want to have a full sp playthrough with this mod (also derailed is basically impossible with this mod lol)
 
@masterhotdog8 ENB is the cause of the save game issue. Nothing I can do about that. And yeah, something in the original unrealistic handling allows jumping across train cars. With realistic physics, that's not possible anymore.
