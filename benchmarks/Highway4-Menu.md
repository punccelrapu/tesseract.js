Why would anyone go to such trouble to get here? Maybe the answer is in some of our reviews. Here's what a reviewer from Arizona posted on TripAdvisor:
 
From the foregoing, you know that we have a Cajun/Creole/Southern based menu with oysters and catfish. We bet you will also like our touffe, softshell crabs and awesome mac & cheese. Be sure to save room at the end for one of our sweets such as the bread puddin' with whisky sauce. Take a look at our menu to see everything but the specials. You can catch those on our Facebook page where they are normally posted on Wednesday mornings.

You MUST follow the instructions in the readme file located in the zip file before proceeding with installation or it WILL NOT WORK!This is the long awaited 140 Highway Sign Package WITH the "DAMN" management. These signs will NOT appear in your standard SC4 menu, but will be organized into your News Ticker and accessable on demand so they will not clutter your menu's.
 
This sign package took me over a year to create and I still have the desire to share it with Simtropolis in hopes that it will give members greater variety options for their freeway network. Combined with the new RHW, I feel it is a great addition. This package will give you the following placement options below...
 
But we still need your support **to stay online**. If you're able to, please consider a donation to help us stay up and running. This helps sustain a platform where we can share our community creations for years to come.
 
By way of a "Thank You" gift, we'd like to send you our **STEX Collector's DVD**. It's some of the best buildings, lots, maps and mods collected for you over the years. Check out the STEX Collections for more info.

For many countries, the cuisine is not only physical culture but also spiritual culture. And when mentioning to beautiful Vietnam, the cuisine is always an interesting topic, especially in Hanoi- the capital of Vietnam.
 
If you are a food enthusiast and would like to explore Vietnamese traditional cuisine, **Highway4 Hanoi** will be an ideal restaurant to satisfy your passion for a variety of delicious specialties of Hanoi and many other religions in Vietnam.
 
The restaurant is always proud of quality because of only using foods and drinks which originate from Vietnam and maintains strict specifications for all dishes in the kitchen, which meets the highest standard of quality and safety.
 
If you love Vietnam cuisine, Highway4 Hanoi will be a fascinating and wonderful eating place for you to hand on experience delicious nourishment that brings the Vietnamese finest specific characters.
 
It is the first international-level Vietnam alcohol with many valuable awards in IWSC (England, 2011) and WSA (the Republic of Austria, 2012) under the valuation of the top fastidious examiners all over the world.
 
The staffs are so professional friendly and enthusiastic, always willing to recommend the most famous specialties of the restaurant for eaters. After you order menu, your foods will be serviced as quickly as possible.
 
From the outside, Highway4 Hanoi is decorated very simply with yellow and reddish-brown tones along with the French ancient architectural features which make a difference from other restaurants in Hanoi.
 
Bamboo fishing-tackles are used to make lampshades or earthenware pots, fresh daisy, and- tuberose pots are placed next to rudimental brick walls. All of them make space more ancient and makes eaters interested and have nice moments to relax beside family and friends and commune with space here.
 
Highway4 Hanoi is located in the west of the Old Quarter, quite near Hang Da market. You can go west down Hang Bo street and go on coming to Bat Dan street. Then, you turn on the right into Bat Su street.
 
Because the restaurant is placed on Hang Bo street, belongs to the Old Quarter where the road is narrow and difficult to find, you may be lost. Thus, you must make sure to have a map on hand or phone if you want to move there yourself.
 
Everyone also likes his or her own private space and favorite restaurant so does it. Sometimes, the simple thing only is a peaceful corner with a canopy of green leaves to stop and gather with some old friends.

Overlooking a private, pebble beach cove, the nature-filled property features six rooms and five stand-alone cottages that mix rustic charm with luxury.
 
Highway 128 intersects the Pacific Coast Highway, so there are plenty of options for extending your road trip. Head south to pass through Jenner, Tomales Bay, and Point Reyes for oysters, kayaking, or hikes among the elks, before arriving in San Francisco.
