Standards allow different programs to communicate with each other. Without them, data remains locked up, its use limited to a small set of applications. But standards liberate information, allowing applications can talk to each other so work can get done efficiently. In the geospatial industry, the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) defines the standards for us. OGC Certification means that our products rigorously comply with the standards.
 
The server products, such as Geospatial SDI and GeoMedia WebMap provide the OGC compliant services and the Geospatial Portal, which is a web application, acts as a connector and consumer for all the OGC compliant services.

Each release must all be re-evaluated for certification. Thus, GeoMedia WebMap 2016 in all tiers (Essentials, Advantage, Professional) and Geospatial SDI 2016 have followed the rigorous tests using a set of OGC test suites that check for interoperability with WFS, WMS and CSW web services.
