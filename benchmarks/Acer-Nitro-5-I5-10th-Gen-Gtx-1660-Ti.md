I often hesitate to recommend a specific brand of laptop. Mainly because depending on price the more expensive laptops generally seem to be built better, regardless of brand. But that's not always the case. At this point I have literally refurbished and fixed thousands of laptops and I can tell you for a fact there is one brand regardless of price that stands out as better built. That brand is Acer. Some people I am sure will wanna argue as they often do. But from my experience even if its a cheaper Acer Chromebook its assembled with not only stronger parts but also with reparability in mind. That doesn't mean that every Acer is gonna have really fast hardware in it. Most laptops have very similar hardware its just the Acer's structure seems to be made with a stronger thicker plastic. It also seems to me that they thought about future repairs, which is smart. Nothing works perfect forever. A lot of laptops have touchpads that are secured in place with melted plastic. If you ever wanna replace it you have to buy the complete top shell. A couple months back I had a cheaper Acer Chromebook in the shop that had a defective mouse pad. I was surprised to see that it was secured with screws and could easily be removed and replaced. I thought, that's interesting. The more I felt the Chromebook the more I was impressed. It was made from thicker stronger plastic than most high end brands. I recently bought a Acer Nitro 5. It's a 17.3 inch gaming laptop. It has a 10th gen i7-10750H with a GeForce GTX 1660Ti with 8GB of vram. It has a 512GB PCIe SSD and 16GB of ram. I have only been using it for a month and like the other Acer products its very well built and is extremely quick. Just thought I would share my thoughts on the brand that I think currently makes very well built machines. My opinion will probably change in the future. But as of now Acer's seem to have better built machines.
