In Apple's Preview app and in Keynote app you can remove background with a click or click and drag like instantly. Recently a friend show me how he removes a background with Pixelmator Pro, literally one click and everything around the object is gone. Knowing that Afinity Photo 2 is a powerful image editor and is marketing for the Pros, I need to know if there's a similar way to extract an object or delete a background with it. In the latest iOS update, I can touch an image on any photo on the iPad and copy just the person without the background instantly. That's how I'm doing as part of the workflow with Affinity Photo 2 on iPad, but today I was trying to do a fast edit on a picture and didn't find a way to achieve this. I literally Airdrop the pic to the iPad and copy the image with one touch and paste it on Affinity Photo, but it has to be a faster way on the desktop version, right? Well I learned you can do the same thing using certain apps on macOS like Preview and Photos and so on... Why I can't find a way to do it inside Affinity Photo? Pixelmator is using the Apple's API, obviously! Am I doing something wrong? Is because Affinity runs in Windows too and can't take advantage of macOS capabilities? Any idea of how to remove a background with a click or click and drag will be appreciated.
 
I'm interested in this too. Seems like a lot of effort has been put into background removal lately. Recent iPhone "pro" models even have a lidar scanner to collect depth information, primarily for background blurring and automatic dodge-and-burn shading or something. A bunch of "aWeSoMe AI" type services have popped up trying to do this too.
 
Fotor seems to have problems with "complex" backgrounds (where the subject and background are too similar in color, or the subject has wispy thin hair etc) even though it's another sUpEr AI type service.
 
I'm also curious what the difference is in Affinity Photo between the background erase tool and the selection brush because while the background erase tool seems to work pretty well, sometimes you just want a mask not a destructive pixel layer edit.
 
By buying the three "flagship" Topaz applications I seem to have gotten a license for Topaz Mask AI (I can't figure out what's up with their licensing right now, they seem a little disorganized as to creating lots of apps and trying to sell them one-off without really explaining what they're thinking in licensing terms) but Mask AI seems a bit broken on my system at the moment.
 
I recently got a project to turn 25 pictures into black and white with colorful light flares passing around the worker model person with shattered particles around their bodies. The client send me the photoshop add-ons and brushes and specifically told me it got to be done in photoshop. 

 
Having a background remover tool would be great. I started doing banner pictures for my daughter's sports teams. I can get the white background removed - just takes time - nothing like the one-click options on many online tools.
 
For difficult daylight sky removals, where there are trees or lots of details on the skyline, I generally use a luminosity mask. This requires multiple steps, so it's not a click and drag, but it gives superior results in my experience.
 
In V2 I still do this manually as the new luminosity mask is a live mask and can't be painted on (there are workarounds for using the new luminosity mask, but it ends up no faster than the method below).
 
Below is an example image where I used this technique to mask out the sky. First image is a crop from a 400% zoom to show the result, the second is the source image and the last is the final, processed version with the replacement sky added.
 
Ive used your products for years and there is NOTHING better on the shelves or online for getting stains out of things. Recently I found a new product of yours (at least to me, it was new) called Color Run Remover. I purchased it only because everything you make works just like it says it will and to have it in my laundry just in case. Well, today was that day. I had washed a new blue t-shirt with my light colored things, thinking is was pretty expensive, it shouldnt run. But you guessed it, it did. My entire wash load turned blue (the yellows were now lime greenyikes). So I used you product (noted above) and IT WORKEDIm so excited. Everything came out perfect and back to the original colors!! How do you do it????? Why are you the only company out there selling such wonderful products..its amazing and I just had to tell how happy I am. Ive told all my friends about your little yellow bottles of stain removers for years.now I have a new product to boast about. Thank you so much for removing the blue from my day!!!
 
I saw an article on this product in my Goodhousekeeping magazine and decided to try it because I had color run stains on my favorite jacket and didnt think there was any hope for it. I used the product and it took ALL of them out and the jacket looks great!!! Thank you so much for your product and I will be recommending it.
 
I wished the directions read in plain English that you should only
