I like it a lot, since I work with sublimation and I need to use other colors and flexi-print helps me a lot from time to time, the touch is very soft and you don't feel anything, the bad thing is that it is a bit expensive for a few sheets that you bring to work with them on a large project is useless for the same reason that it is a bit expensive
 
I am a first time 3-D printer. I tried printing this flexi cat but the bridges were fused to the top part of the cat, making the flexi not bendable at all. Anybody can help? Thank you. As I looked at the picture, I also realized the print was not so clean ...
 
You place the part(s) in Prusa Slicer, select your profiles etc exactly as you do for slicing and then you use File>Save Project As. This will save a .3mf file to the location you specify just like saving any other file. The 3mf file when saved from Prusa Slicer will create a snapshot of your work environment. So it will save the model(s), any modifiers you may be using, placement, and a copy of all the profiles currently selected.
Its the best way to debug things as we don't have to keep asking about all the settings etc. Its also a good habit to save any project for normal use unless doing a 1 off.

These things can be tricky. If you're slightly overextruding, the tolerances that worked for the model's designer may not work for you, so the parts are fused. One thing you can try is to simply scale the model a bit in prusaslicer, say to 105%, to create more space.
 
I broke open the file to examine the joints; there are a couple of beginner errors but the file should print if the printer is really well set up 'though there are probably some better designed ones somewhere.
 
First layers are very important for this kind of print - if the pictures show the bottom layer, there is a ways to improve the Z here. And don't print a "print in place" print at draft mode. Start at .2mm resolution.
 
Generic PETG... Print in place is trickier with PETG than PLA. PETG needs to be very precisely dialled in to avoid seized or irregular moving surfaces. I would try again with PLA or a PETG for which Prusa supplies a tailored profile.
 
To confirm, your file finally attached fine. I have looked over your .3mf file and it looks to be in order, I was going to make the same suggestion as Diem, try printing the file in PLA and see how it turns out. another suggestion worth mentioning again is you may be over extruding as Fuchsr mentioned above, your image is showing signs of this. I would suggest calibrating the extrusion multiplier for the PETG your using (you never did mention what brand) they are not all created equal.
 
An articulated and flexible model coming directly from the printing plate of your 3D printer, you've been dreaming about it for a long time! More and more designers are offering 3D files that can be easily print-in-place without any support and that are flexible, here is our selection!
 
Here is our selection of the **best flexible STL files**, all these beautiful creations are from the **3D file library** Cults and are perfectly **printable in 3D**. The majority of these models are even **print-in-place no support and do not require assembly**. Simply detach them from the print tray of your printer and start playing with them.
 
For a long time, 3D printing was confined to very simple objects. They were certainly very pretty, but there wasn't that **additional soul that comes from flexibility**. It is now possible to **print articulated 3D models** which are much more playful. Critics of personal 3D printing just have to behave themselves. All you have to do is show them a super pretty but also articulated object to make them aware of the extent of the possibilities.
 
For an even more incredible effect, you can even print in several colours or change the filament during printing to vary the effects. Your **3D prints will be great gifts for Christmas or birthdays**!
 
Ive been using flexisign pro cloud 11 for a month now and it has worked flawlessly. last night I tried sending a print and contour cut through the rip and print exactly as I have been doing and it said rip error. I did some research and people said clear the prefrences so I did and still no luck. I unistalled the software and reinstalled and once again no luck. Im getting rip error 29 which it says plugin error and unknown operator. Can someone please help me. Thanks
 
See if clearing up some of the temp files Flexi generates will help.
Look in preferences under the options tag to see the directory it is using.
All those can go.
If you have a long list of print jobs on "hold" in the PM that have been printed get rid of all that you can there. (not the archived jobs).

Once flexi is cleaned up do the same for your Windows system.
Clean up the hard drive and make sure you have enough swap space for flexi to use when ripping.
 
Okay great I will try that. But I wouldn't think that would help now just for the fact that I uninstalled all the software and reinstalled so there shouldn't be anything In there right? It would there still be something from the previous software?
 
Also how would I rasterize the image and not the contour cut line because if I rasterize before I add contour cut line it wants to put the contour line in like a square shape and if I do it after I add the cut line it makes it part of the image right?
 
Okay I'll clean them up and see what happens I know I did look at the bottom a little bit ago and it said I had 5.6 gun ram fee and 350gb hard space free so I would think that would be more than enough.

Good EveningAfter Sep/Oct Microsoft patches for Win 11 HP Flexi Print & Cut 21 - 64 bit version fails to launch (gets to loading Fonts) then closes. No errors reportedNow the 32bit version launches fine and worksI have un-installed Flexi and re-installed after a reboot still the same issue.
 
Hi @color tunnelIf you receive an error message with a specific error code, try running Windows Update to troubleshoot. If that doesn't solve the problem, see Fix Windows Update errors and follow the instructions to help resolve common update problems.
 
Hi @Donkey Kong Here is my recommendation: The issue seems to be related to the printer and not the media HP Prime Gloss 13. I recommend checking the PrintHead and performing an Image-quality maintenance > Clean printheadsIf the problem persists, please contact your support representative.
