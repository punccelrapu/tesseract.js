Singer Suraj (Rajesh Khanna) was presented with a tanpura by his fiance's father. Thereafter, he often listens to a haunting song at nights and observes that its name was "Ratna". One day, while going for a stage show, he gets stuck in heavy rain in an unknown place and goes to stay in a small motel, where he meets a woman named Ratna. During the night, he observes that Ratna, singing the same song he often hears at night, is going to a distant palace. He follows her instinctively and enters the abandoned palace. He tries to call out for Ratna, but learns from the old keeper of the palace that Ratna died more than 1000 years ago and people feel that she still haunts that place.

Later, a portrait of Ratna makes him remember their previous life. In the previous life he was Prakash, chief singer of royal court. He was in love with Ratna, a beautiful and talented court dancer. They do not consummate their relationship as Prakash was already promised to Jamuna in his childhood and Ratna was to become a royal courtesan. However, they decided to elope, but were killed on their way, promising each other that they would meet again.
 
Suraj, after coming to his senses, feels lonely and confused. Shortly thereafter, he meets a gypsy, Jhumri (also Malini), who is Ratna's reincarnation. Soon he makes Jhumri remember her past life and her love for Prakash. This angers Rita Malhotra (Asha Sachdev), Suraj's fiance and Popatlal (Prem Chopra), who wants to marry Jhumri. Popatlal steals the portrait, and sets the gypsies against Suraj, ensuring a fight between Suraj and gypsies. But Suraj and Jhumri manage to overcome all the obstacles and consummate their relationship this time despite all odds.
