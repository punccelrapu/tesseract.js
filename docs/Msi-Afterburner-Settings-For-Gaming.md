The most common tool used for GPU overclocking is MSI Afterburner and as with any other tool, there are settings you need to familiarize yourself with to use the utility to its maximum potential.

To give you a headstart and help you get to the fun part of overclocking I will talk about some settings you need to know about to achieve the best possible performance and stability while overclocking.
 
These settings will allow you to increase the amount of power your GPU can use (still within its specifications since you can draw more power only by physical mods on the GPU) and stabilize your clocks with constant voltage.
 
To minimize startup clutter you can disable the Start with Windows options and simply enable your OC every time you boot into your Windows manually. When not needed you do not have to enable your OC to save power and lower the thermal output of your GPU.
 
For the Monitoring tab, all you should know is that you should disable all of the options so they do not pull information in the background and only enable the monitoring when you need to check on your PC parts during gaming loads, etc.
 
The rest of the tabs include optional features like benchmarking (which is useful when testing different drivers while gaming), screen capture, video capture, and user interface. These settings will not influence your ability to tune your OC and will not clutter your PC with services and hardware readings, so these are all personal preferences.

With your values dialed in, you should create a profile and apply the values while you are gaming along with a custom power plan that disables idle on your CPU for the most stable latency and polling rate.

I have a helios 300 predator ph315-53 and i am wondering, when i play games like farm sim 22 , tom clancys wildlands, my temps normally hit late 70s to mid 80's. and really pushes my cpu temps hard. I just recently got into using throttlestop but the settings i did, didn't really do much. I found out I could undervolt with msi afterburner which I use to keep track of in game temps and after adjuting the core clock to +160 and the power limit to 75, it made my temps around the max of 68 to 69, without going to 70. so i was able to game much longer but also lowered my fps in game. im wondering though, what is the best settings for my rtx 2060 6gb, 16gb memory and 10705H i7 cpu. under power limit, temp limit and core clock and memory clock and core voltage in msi afterburner?
 
Also, make sure that all your laptop vents are clean, all your cpu/gpu fans are clean and working 100% and you have repasted both cpu and gpu chips with a high end paste like the Thermal Grizzly high temp paste, as all this will reduce your temps considerably and it also helps if you have a quick read/write M.2 ssd PCIe 3 x4 and run this laptop with at least 16GB (preferably 32GB or even 64GB total ram) 2x ram modules and not just a 1x ram module, as that will make your laptop memory operate in dual channel ram that is much superior than single channel ram for gaming and high end usage.
 
Yesterday I decided to try using msi afterburner and overclocking my laptop for the first time. I had no background information going into it so I was just following youtube tutorials on it. And a heads up, I am not very knowledgeable about things like this in general regarding laptops.

The rest I wanted to use msi afterburner is because my laptop has impressive parts in it, yet I have now had it for about 1-2 years and it has slowed down a decent amount (due to my lack of knowledge on how to manage a computer). The main game I play is Escape from Tarkov and it is a demanding game when it comes to specs. My specs should be good enough to be constantly at 120 fps except this is not the case. My game has been running at about 50-65 fps for the past year. It annoys me that I have such a nice laptop yet I can't run this game to perfection. This is because I don't know how to take the best care of my laptop but I honestly don't know where to start to find such information. So overtime my laptop has just gotten worse and worse. It is still good enough to play most games at max fps at 60-144 fps but Escape from Tarkov has been giving me fps problems for the past year I've been playing it. So when I used msi afterburner I set the core clock (MHz) to +150 and the memory clock (MHz) to +350.

I did this around noon yesterday and when I opened Tarkov I was able to play on reserve, the most visually demanding map in the map, at a smooth 90-110 fps. I was super happy and I was also able to stream it on discord without any fps drops. Normally when I stream Tarkov on discord my fps drops by 10fps which sucks but at that point it was perfect. I went to do some class work and hours later that day I tried to play Tarkov again. At first my fps was nice but then around 2 minutes into the game it began to tank. And when I say tank I mean tank. It went from 90fps to 60 then to 51 and after a minute at 50ish it dropped to 30fps. My Tarkov has never gone down to fps 30 before. And it stayed there for the rest of the time I spent playing. Whenever I would load into a game, it would start off at 60+fps and then drop and stabilize at 30-40 fps. I have tried to run the game with +0/+0 MHz settings on msi afterburner and it still ends up dropping to 30-40 fps. I have no clue as to why this is happening and I am looking for any advice from anyone who is knowledgeable in this. I am still able to run other games like SW Battlefront 2, max settings at 120fps but Tarkov does not work anymore. The game is unplayable for me in this state and it's upsetting to have a nice laptop yet I can't run a game at all. The msi afterburner most definitely was the cause of this but I am unsure as why. When my Tarkov is running its memory on task manager is 97-99% at around 7000-8000 MB if that could possibly be helpful information. I do not think it went this high before so maybe msi afterburner caused a memory leak, but once again I have no clue.

My overall question is seeking help on fixing what happened to my laptop after attempting to overclock it with msi afterburner. As well as seeking out information on how to restore a laptop to its highest potential.
 
If anyone can help me with this I would appreciate it so much. And even if someone cannot fix this exact problem if anyone has any advice in general on how to manage or refix my laptop I would gladly listen to anything. My specs should allow me to play almost every game at max settings, max fps, but this is no longer the case after using my laptop for over a year.
 
MSI Afterburner is fairly simple to use, but you may find it a bit overwhelming as a newcomer trying to navigate through its settings and toggles. Follow the step-by-step guide below if you're wondering how to get started.
 
I also recommend installing PCMark. While it's paid software, the basic edition (which is free) serves as a decent alternative to FurMark if you want to benchmark your GPU or stress test the overclock/undervolt settings.
 
It's often confused with underclocking, which is the process of decreasing the core clock to lower the GPU temperature under load. A key difference between the two is that underclocking your graphics card almost always decreases performance, while undervolting (if performed correctly) leads to a negligible loss in clock speed. By decreasing the voltage supplied to your GPU, undervolting can prevent it from thermal throttling, and you might even see some improvement in its performance.
 
You can also use MSI Afterburner to keep an eye on your hardware statistics such as the GPU and CPU temperature, in-game FPS, and RAM usage. Assuming you've already installed the Rivatuner Statistics Server extension for MSI Afterburner, you can follow these steps to customize the On-Screen Display (OSD) for your games.
 
Sometimes, certain metrics like the minimum, maximum, average, and 1% low FPS may not show up on the overlay even if you enable them in the **Monitoring** tab. Luckily, you force them to appear in the OSD by pressing the hotkey used to benchmark your PC. You can set this hotkey by heading to the **Benchmark** tab in MSI Afterburner's **Settings** and entering your preferred key combination for the **Begin recording** option under the **Global benchmark hotkeys** section.
 
MSI Afterburner also allows you to record your screen and includes plenty of video formats, including MJPG, RTV1, and NV12 compression. On top of that, it even supports H.264 video encoding, making it a decent option if you want to capture your favorite gameplay moments.
 
These are some ways you can use MSI Afterburner to get the most performance out of your GPU. Every GPU is built differently, so you'll have to experiment with different overclock and undervolt configurations that work with your specific graphics card.
