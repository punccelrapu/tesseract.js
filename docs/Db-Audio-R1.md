Unlike any other In Ear Monitor, the 3DME Gen 2 continues its unique position as the only IEM with built in, active ambient microphones with an App to customize the mix. Gen 2 adds a monitor bypassing capability, whereby limiter and EQ functions can still be controlled from Front of House or a Monitor position when activated.
 
Also added is a lower limiter threshold, start up squeal suppressor (useful if the 3DME is turned on prior to inserting the ear pieces), an extended battery life to full eight hours on a single charge and an improved CROS function for Musicians with hearing limits in one ear.
 
The  HTML element is used to embed sound content in documents. It may contain one or more audio sources, represented using the src attribute or the element: the browser will choose the most suitable one. It can also be the destination for streamed media, using a MediaStream.

The above example shows simple usage of the element. In a similar manner to the element, we include a path to the media we want to embed inside the src attribute; we can include other attributes to specify information such as whether we want it to autoplay and loop, whether we want to show the browser's default audio controls, etc.
 
**Note:** Sites that automatically play audio (or videos with an audio track) can be an unpleasant experience for users, so should be avoided when possible. If you must offer autoplay functionality, you should make it opt-in (requiring a user to specifically enable it). However, this can be useful when creating media elements whose source will be set at a later time, under user control. See our autoplay guide for additional information about how to properly use autoplay.
 
The controlslist attribute, when specified, helps the browser select what controls to show for the audio element whenever the browser shows its own set of controls (that is, when the controls attribute is specified).
 
Sends a cross-origin request without a credential. In other words, it sends the Origin: HTTP header without a cookie, X.509 certificate, or performing HTTP Basic authentication. If the server does not give credentials to the origin site (by not setting the Access-Control-Allow-Origin: HTTP header), the resource will be tainted, and its usage restricted.
 
Sends a cross-origin request with a credential. In other words, it sends the Origin: HTTP header with a cookie, a certificate, or performing HTTP Basic authentication. If the server does not give credentials to the origin site (through Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: HTTP header), the resource will be tainted and its usage restricted.
 
When not present, the resource is fetched without a CORS request (i.e. without sending the Origin: HTTP header), preventing its non-tainted use in elements. If invalid, it is handled as if the enumerated keyword **anonymous** was used. See CORS settings attributes for additional information.
 
A Boolean attribute used to disable the capability of remote playback in devices that are attached using wired (HDMI, DVI, etc.) and wireless technologies (Miracast, Chromecast, DLNA, AirPlay, etc.). See this proposed specification for more information.
 
The default controls have a display value of inline by default, and it is often a good idea to set the value to block to improve control over positioning and layout, unless you want it to sit within a text block or similar.
 
You can style the default controls with properties that affect the block as a single unit, so for example you can give it a border and border-radius, padding, margin, etc. You can't however style the individual components inside the audio player (e.g. change the button size or icons, change the font, etc.), and the controls are different across the different browsers.
 
To get a consistent look and feel across browsers, you'll need to create custom controls; these can be marked up and styled in whatever way you want, and then JavaScript can be used along with the HTMLMediaElement API to wire up their functionality.
 
You can detect when tracks are added to and removed from an element using the addtrack and removetrack events. However, these events aren't sent directly to the element itself. Instead, they're sent to the track list object within the element's HTMLMediaElement that corresponds to the type of track that was added to the element:
 
This code watches for audio tracks to be added to and removed from the element, and calls a hypothetical function on a track editor to register and remove the track from the editor's list of available tracks.
 
Audio with spoken dialog should provide both captions and transcripts that accurately describe its content. Captions, which are specified using WebVTT, allow people who are hearing impaired to understand an audio recording's content as the recording is being played, while transcripts allow people who need additional time to be able to review the recording's content at a pace and format that is comfortable for them.
 
The element doesn't directly support WebVTT. You will have to find a library or framework that provides the capability for you, or write the code to display captions yourself. One option is to play your audio using a element, which does support WebVTT.
 
In addition to spoken dialog, subtitles and transcripts should also identify music and sound effects that communicate important information. This includes emotion and tone. For example, in the WebVTT below, note the use of square brackets to provide tone and emotional insight to the viewer; this can help establish the mood otherwise provided using music, nonverbal sounds and crucial sound effects, and so forth.
 
This example specifies which audio track to embed using the src attribute on a nested element rather than directly on the element. It is always useful to include the file's MIME type inside the type attribute, as the browser is able to instantly tell if it can play that file, and not waste time on it if not.
