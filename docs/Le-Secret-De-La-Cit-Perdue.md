The first is proprietary competitive advantage gained through use of the IP coupled with the right to exclude others from such use. The second is by monetizing IP directly through licensing to others. While stand-alone trade secret licensing may not be as common as with other forms of IP, it does occur.1
 
Governments provide patent holders the right to exclude others using a patented invention for a limited time based in part on invention disclosure. In contrast, the right to exclude others from use of a trade secret arises from limited disclosure and reasonable efforts to maintain secrecy.
 
It seemed like a simple enough question, and one I got to wondering about recently while working on a feature about a Purdue research machinist who last summer spent his time repairing and remaking most of the 216 pieces of custom hardware on the 92-year-old drum.

So I marched over to the Elliott Hall of Music to find the band's marketing director, Susan Xioufaridou. She promptly spurned my query, insisting the dimensions of the drum always have been a band secret.
 
I scoured the Internet, figuring the drum's dimensions likely were buried on some obscure blog, as most pieces of trivia usually are, only to come up empty. There were lots of estimates for the diameter, but they were decidedly less than precise, ranging from 8 feet to 10 feet.
 
What I did discover right away was that there's a lot of competition for the title of "World's Largest Drum," which probably explains why Purdue keeps the actual dimensions under its hat, er, shiny steel helmet.
 
A few drums in Asia and Europe easily tower over the Boilermakers' drum, with the Guinness World Record holder in South Korea measuring in at a diameter of 18 feet 2 inches. Even the naked eye can see Purdue's drum doesn't come close.
 
At this point, I was determined not to be beaten on this story. I sought out Purdue's resident expert on calculating big things: Steve Wereley, the mechanical engineering professor who calculated the size of the massive BP Deepwater Horizon oil rig spill in 2010.
 
Wereley, who presumably had much better things to do, was good-natured about my odd request, and accomplished the task in all of 15 minutes. (He admits it took him a bit longer to figure out the size of the oil spill, which he accomplished with the help of an expert team and the U.S. government.)

The photo that held the key was one Purdue itself published in 2008, after a football game against the University of Oregon. There was the drum, in all its glory, on the Ross-Ade Stadium football field during an All-American Marching Band performance.
 
Since the NCAA establishes uniform guidelines for the size of the markings on a football field, Wereley said the math was relatively simple. He used the 5-yard line to calculate the diameter and the field's hash marks to figure out the width.
 
Wereley calculated the drum's diameter to be 7 feet 5 inches. He estimated the width to be 3 feet 10 inches. While he couldn't be completely sure of his accuracy, he estimated his calculations were correct within inches.
 
Even with a margin for error, that's smaller than the size of the University of Texas and University of Missouri drums. Purdue's claim to possess the "World's Largest Drum" was starting to look like what politicians delicately like to call a "stranger to the truth."
 
While aggressively marketing OxyContin, the Sackler family also sought to profit off the drug abuse crisis its company helped create by exploring selling drugs used to treat addiction and reverse overdoses, state lawyers contend in previously secret parts of their lawsuit against Purdue Pharma.
 
Years later, the state says in the suit, consulting firm McKinsey & Co. advised Purdue that it could increase opioid prescriptions by sending sales reps dozens of times per year to visit prolific prescribers.
 
The Sackler family was given a report in 2012 that found savings cards to help pay for OxyContin led to 60 percent more patients using the drug for more than three months. An internal company report from that year found that every dollar invested in the savings cards brought in more than $4 in additional sales.
 
The suit is one of more than 1,000 by state and local governments pending against Purdue. A federal judge in Cleveland overseeing lawsuits filed in federal court is pushing for a settlement aimed at stemming the crisis.
 
President Donald J. Trump nominated Perdue to be secretary of agriculture in January 2017. The US Senate confirmed him by a vote of 87 to 11, and on April 25, 2017, Sonny Perdue was sworn in as the 31st United States Secretary of Agriculture. He served as secretary of agriculture for Trump's entire term.
 
The two debated on television Wednesday night for what should have been the second of three debates. Perdue was so embarrassed by his inability to match Ossoff that he has pulled out of the third debate scheduled for this weekend.
 
He was referring to a number of stock trades Perdue made in the beginning of the pandemic after he received a secret briefing about the coming plague, a briefing available only to a select group of senators. In that secret briefing, Perdue was informed that the American people were facing a disaster of historic proportions once the virus took hold in this country.
 
Perdue, stone-faced and silent, sat there as Ossoff ticked off his powerful indictment of the criminal GOP senator, guilty not only of ignoring the health needs of his people but of illegal use of the health crisis to conduct insider trading on his own behalf.
 
Perdue, a Trump sycophant, was one of several senators who came under fire earlier this year after they made high-value insider stock trades in the days after the secret briefing warning lawmakers of the impending pandemic and its likely economic consequences.
 
John Wojcik is Editor-in-Chief of People's World. He joined the staff as Labor Editor in May 2007 after working as a union meat cutter in northern New Jersey. There, he served as a shop steward and a member of a UFCW contract negotiating committee. In the 1970s and '80s, he was a political action reporter for the Daily World, this newspaper's predecessor, and was active in electoral politics in Brooklyn, New York.
 
During the period 1935-1941, research activities in the physics department proceeded almost as if America's entry into World War II had been forseen and that the department would play an important role in the associated war effort. The number of tenure/tenure-track faculty almost doubled, increasing from 7 to 13 during this period and the research productivity as indexed by publications in the Physical Review went up proportionally to nearly 25 publications per year. It was during this period that the department became a major player in nuclear physics research, with the construction of a Van de Graaff accelerator and, more importantly, a cyclotron which would give the department unique capabilities for carrying out research during war time.
 
As envisioned, the Van de Graaff accelerator was designed to produce a stream of neutrons through "high energy" deuteron-deuteron collisions with the resultant neutron flux then being used to study neutron diffraction and neutron activation of heavy elements. Three graduate students, R.E. Schreiber, R.E. Holmquist and W.A. Miller, worked on and completed the construction of this accelerator in 1937 at a total cost of only $825.62 above the cost of labor! Unfortunately, the resultant 250 KeV neutron beam only had a flux of about 0.25 milliampere which was too small to be useful for studying neutron diffraction. However, two years later in 1939, following the discovery in Germany by Otto Hahn, Lisa Meitner, and Fritz Strassmann of the fission of uranium when bombarded with low energy neutrons, the Van de Graaff was put to use to study fission fragments. Detection of the fragments was done by the use of photographic plates.
 
In 1935, the department also initiated a second major nuclear physics effort with the construction of then recently invented cyclotron. This invention, which made it possible to accelerate charged particles to higher energies than was possible using the Van de Graaff, was constructed with an unbelievably low budget of $9,000--plus, of course, many hours of graduate student labor. It was clear at the beginning of the planning process that there was going to be very little money available outside the normal departmental budget, so the goal was to produce a small but useful machine at the lowest possible cost. In 1936, Hubert Jose Yearian and John Howe--in consultation with Hans A. Bethe--undertook the design of the steel parts of the magnet which was subsequently manufactured by the Carnegie-Illinois Steel Corporation in Chicago. In a letter dated 18 March 1936, to Mr. W. Mathesius, the Manager of Operations, at Carnegie-Illinois Steel, Lark-Horovitz wrote in part:
 
By December of 1938, the cyclotron was producing a useful current of 3 microamps of 8.3 MeV deuterons; a current sufficient to undertake a variety of cutting-edge scientific studies in nuclear physics.
 
Studies of nuclear reactions were begun immediately and these continued throughout the long life of the cyclotron. In addition, Lark-Horovitz who had been interested for a number of years in the application of physical techniques to the solution of biological problems, used the cyclotron to pioneer radioactive tracer methods. Assisted by Dr. Herta Leng, who was an AAUW(3) research fellow in the department at the time, and Dr. Donald Tendam, Lark-Horovitz began an extensive program using these techniques. One of these studies dealt with the uptake, distributions and excr
