Responsible for creating and updating a biennial environmental scan for the association that encompasses trends in academic librarianship, higher education, and the broader environment, e.g., economic, demographic, political, for release at the ACRL conference. Identifies the ACRL Top 10 Trends" for release every two years in non-ACRL conference years.
 
2018 Top Trends in Academic Libraries (June 2018)

The ACRL Research Planning and Review Committee is responsible for creating and updating a continuous and dynamic environmental scan for the association that encompasses trends in academic librarianship, higher education, and the broader environment. As a part of this effort, the committee develops a list of the top trends that are affecting academic libraries now and in the near future.

Environmental Scan 2017 (March 2017) (PDF)

The 2017 environmental scan by the ACRL Research Planning and Review Committee explores the current atmosphere in the world of academic and research libraries along with trends that will define the future of academic and research librarianship and the research environment. The document builds on earlier ACRL reports, identifying several emerging issues.


 
The University of Southern California (USC) is committed to enhancing and expanding its current institutional infrastructure through increased support of faculty teams interested in pursuing funding from federal agencies and other external sponsors. A critical aspect of many funding opportunities requires planning and the development of collaborations among researchers across disciplines, departments, and even institutions, resulting in a cohesive research program and singular objective that would not be feasible through a standalone research project. The aim of this Request for Proposals is not to fund specific research projects, but rather to support teams of faculty who aim to plan and establish or foster a community of researchers at USC and potentially at external, partnering organizations, organized around a broad topic of shared interest. Support will be provided for groups of investigators to communicate, plan, and coordinate their efforts across disciplinary, organizational, institutional, and geographical boundaries. The objectives are to facilitate open communication and exchange of information and resources; to integrate research, infrastructure, and the activities of a multidisciplinary team of scientists working independently on topics of common interest; to nurture a sense of community amongst researchers; and to minimize isolation and maximize cooperation so as to eliminate unnecessary duplication of efforts.
 
**Behavioral Science and Well-Being Policy Initiative**
The Behavioral Science and Well-Being Policy Initiative brings together behavioral scientists, behavioral economists, behavioral decision researchers, and psychologists from across USC to develop insights from behavioral science and related fields and inform policies on well-being, as well as health, finances, climate change, and security. They also support the Behavioral Science Society for undergraduate students, graduate students and postdocs. Led by Wandi Bruine de Bruin, Jason Doctor, Arie Kapteyn, Gulden Ulkumen, Dan Simon and Leor Hackel.
 
**Center for Mindfulness Science**
The mission of the USC Center for Mindfulness Science is to to cultivate individual and societal awareness, well-being, and the relief of suffering through a scientific understanding of the impact of mindfulness and related practices on human consciousness and health. They do this by advancing the scientific understanding of mindfulness practices and their impact on health and well-being. Led by Baruch Cahn, Shawn Roll, Randye Semple, David Black, Jordan Davis, and Eric Pedersen.
 
**Collaborations in History, Art, Religion, Music
**Religions and their historical contexts underlie a broad span of human activity from the creation of great art and architecture to deep-seated gender and racial bias, as well as the interrelationships between humanity, other living beings, and the natural environment. The academic study of religion, from a variety of disciplinary perspectives, is an urgent priority for institutions of higher education that seek to prepare members of their community to rise to meet the challenges of compelling social questions and grave global challenges. The Art, Religion and History Collaborative Group has an exceeding expansive constituency, deeply rooted at USC and reaching out to neighboring institutions, and an impressively wide range in perspectives on art, religion, and history. Led by Lisa Pon, Adam Gilbert, Frederic Clark, Andreas Kratky, Sonya Lee, and Lisa Bitel.
 
**Collaborative for Embedding Mental Health Resources in Non-Traditional Spaces
**The Collaborative for Embedding Mental Health Resources in Non-Traditional Spaces brings together faculty, staff and students from multiple schools at USC, along with community partners, to identify and amplify effective mental health practices that currently exist in the community; share methods of practicing self-care that might be overlooked by mainstream approaches; and determine ways to expand mental health services in non-traditional spaces such as skate parks, parks, and shopping centers. Led by Zoe Corwin, Rafael Angulo and Alan Green.
 
**Law & Global Health Collaboration**
Virtually all significant global health topics raise challenging legal issues which are better understood and addressed when considered from a multidisciplinary basis. Since 2016, the USC Law & Global Health Collaboration has stimulated multidisciplinary research and elevated work being done locally and globally, and has become known for cutting-edge and creative exploration of issues at the intersection of law and global health. Led by Sofia Gruskin and Laura Ferguson.
 
**Metaplasticity and Megaplasticity: Changing the Brain from Synapse to Community**
The USC Metaplasticity and Megaplasticity: Changing the Brain from Synapse to Community is a collaboration between Keck and Dornsife that aims to gain novel perspectives towards understanding both the parameters of lifestyle as well as investigating underlying mechanisms of neuroplasticity critical for developing brain resilience in aging and disease. Led by Giselle Petzinger, Michael Jakowec, Emily Roxworthy, Jesus Diaz, Daryl Davies, Terry Church, Patrick Corbin and Charlie Kaplan.
 
**Strengthening Community-Engaged Sustainability Scholarship & Education**
