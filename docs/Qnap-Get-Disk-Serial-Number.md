The most common performance characteristics measured are sequential and random operations. We measure disk performance in IOPS or Input/Output per second. One read request or one write request = 1 IOPS. Each disk in you storage system can provide a certain amount of IOPS based off of the rotational speed, average latency and average seek time.

To do a basic RAW IOPS calculation for 4 hard drives at 7,200 RPM, we can assume the total RAW IOPS are 500 IOPS. We can calculate this by taking the total number of drives multiply by the number of RAW IOPS for each drive (4 HDD x 125 IOP = 500 IOPS).
 
Due to the nature of mechanical drives, accessing/writing data sequentially is much faster than accessing/writing it randomly because of the way in which the disk hardware works. Sequential I/O on mechanical drives can generally be served at a higher throughput because there is less seek operation by the disk head and at the same time larger data segment can be read/written during a single platter rotation.
 
Random access involves a higher number of seek operations, which means random read and especially random write will deliver a lower rate of throughput and IOPS. During random I/O, the position of the disk head, seek disk rotational delay, and seek time will cause significant performance penalty.
 
Example
For mechanical disk-based systems, where each disk seek will take around 10ms. Sequentially writing data to that same disk takes about 30 ms per MB. So if you sequentially write 100 MB of data to a disk, it will take around 3 seconds. But if you do 100 random writes of 1MB each, that will take a total of 4 seconds (3 seconds for the actual writing, and 10 ms \* 100 = 1 second for all the seeking).
 
QNAP NAS storage supports different types of RAID Level, each RAID Level have different capacity and performance metrics. Before deploying your storage, understand what kind of work load your storage will be expected to perform.

**RAID 5:**
Works best for medium performance, general purpose and sequential work loads. Normally RAID 5 will be use because it is a more economical choice, with only 1 drive being used for parity. For performance demanding applications, RAID 5 is not the best choice.
 
**RAID 6:**
Works best for read biased work loads such as archiving and backup purposes, but not the best choice for performance demanding applications, especially for a random write intensive environment.
 
A customer has a IT environment with two Vmware ESXi 6.0 host servers, it is cluster, and needs to run 20 VMs using the QNAP NAS as the storage back-end. The customer surveyed and took a inventory of all his VMs and found the following work load pattern in his environment.
 
A customer has a graphic render farm with about 50 Nodes. All 50 Nodes will simultaneously read the source media library from the storage, render the data and then write the result back onto the storage for further processing. Since all 50 Nodes first read the media and then write the result back to the storage concurrently, this created a major random IOPS bottle neck using all mechanical drives. Since both high performance and large storage capacity is require for the graphic render process, we can optimize the QNAP NAS storage the following way.
 
**Storage Pool using LVM**
You can use QNAP flexible volume management to better manage your storage capacity. The storage pool aggregates hard drives into a bigger storage space, and with the ability to support multiple RAID groups, the storage pool can offer more redundant protection and reduce risk of data crash.
 
Once a Storage Pool has been created, you can choose from three different methods to create your volume on top of the pool. The type of volume you want to create depends on whether you want flexibility or performance.
 
**Static Volume:**
Static volume will take up all of available space within the storage pool, it pre-allocate and pre-prepare the space for optimal read / write access. Since Static Volume takes up all of the Storage Pool space, you cannot create multiple multiple volume within the same pool.
 
**Thick Volume:**
Thick Volume offers a combination of space flexibility and performance, you can choose how much space to assign to a Thick Volume from the Storage Pool. This means you can create multiple Thick or Thin volume within the same Storage Pool. Once the desire Thick Volume size has been chosen, it pre-allocate and pre-prepare the space for read / write access.
 
**Thin Volume:**
Thin provisioning allows storage space to be used more flexibly. Thin Volume does not actually use physical storage space during volume creation, rather physical space is only use during write allocation. This means you can provision a Thin Volume size that is larger than your physical storage size. You can create multiple Thin volume within the same storage pool. Due to Thin Volume space flexibility, there is a performance impact during work load.
 
**mSATA and SSD Read/Write Cache Acceleration:**
Solid state drive (SSD) cache technology is based on disk I/O reading caches. When the applications of the Turbo NAS access the hard drive(s), the data will be stored in the SSD. When the same data are accessed by the applications again, they will be read/write from the SSD cache instead of the hard drive(s). The commonly accessed data are stored in the SSD cache. The hard drive(s) will only be accessed when the data could not be found from the SSD
 
But i don't think it will work, or at least this rule will apply to only ONE disk because according to this and this issue the disks are named TR-004 DISK00, TR-004 DISK01, TR-004 DISK02 and TR-004 DISK03. BTW, the mentioned issue does not mention a problem with duplicate serial numbers.
 
and in this issue you can clearly see the ID\_MODEL has underscore when he runs udevadm too & as he said he's running snapRAID I assume that means it's only presenting as 1 disk in OMV and he doesn't have the serial number issue.
 
I had tried a version like the one you provided however it didn't work. I realize now I think it's because every disk has a different model name so you need to use ID\_MODEL\_ID. Now I tried with this and it works:
 
I have a QNAP TS-251+ NAS server with two bays. This is for home use and cloud function with mobile applications, with full disk LUKS encryption system and 2 shared and encrypted folders, I know the passwords.
 
In bay number 1 I had a 18TB disk for data and in bay number 2 I had a 2TB disk used for NAS applications. Further investigation revealed a Raid 1. I did not have them configured in Raid, but searched the web there are many comments that sayQnap disks configured in single use are Raid 1 type.
 
Due to network connection problems I could not access the server by any way.I did a 3 minute reset to restore the network settings to default values, at which point the disks were in place. This did not solve the connection problem.
 
I decided to do a hard reset with the 18TB disk out of the NAS. When all the configuration was reset, I connected it back to the NAS, but it did not recognize the disk 18TB configuration, only recognized the disk as new. I don't understand why.
 
It has all kinds of recovery solutions, works very well with **LUKS**, **RAID** and **eCryptFS** systems. It recognizes several types of file systems. In the end I was able to recover my files.
 
I bought a QNAP TS-451+ NAS a number of years ago. At the time, you could only set up what are now called "static volumes"; these are volumes that are composed of a number of disks in some RAID configuration. After a firmware update, QNAP introduced "storage pools", which act as a layer in between the RAIDed disks and the volumes on top of them. Storage pools can do snapshots and some other fancy things, but the important thing here is that QNAP was pushing storage pools now, and I had a static volume.
 
I wanted to migrate from my old static volume to a new storage pool. I couldn't really find any examples of anyone who had performed such a migration successfully; most of the advice on the Internet was basically, "back up your stuff and reformat". Given the fact that my volume was almost full and that QNAP does not support an in-place migration, I figured that if I added on some extra storage in the form of an expansion unit, I could probably pull it off with minimal hassle.
 
This firmware recovery guide is intended for users who encounter system startup failure due to incomplete or unsuccessful firmware update caused by power outage or network disconnection during the process. To verify if this guide applies to your NAS, follow the steps below:
 
 1. Power off the NAS.
 2. Remove all the hard disks.
 3. Power on the NAS.
 4. Wait for ten seconds and check if you hear a short beep.
 5. After the short beep, wait for two minutes to check if you hear a long beep.
 6. If you only hear a short beep or do not hear any beep, follow the instructions of this guide to recover your NAS.
 
Note: To make sure if the data has been delvering to NAS or not, you can login to the console by the username and password, root/root. Then, use the command "ifconfig" to see if the number of TX on eth0 is increasing or not.
 
NOTE: If the recover progress does not work at the first time, please try another PC and make sure all other network connections are disabled. If the number of TX on eth0 is not increasing, please use another Ethernet cable.
