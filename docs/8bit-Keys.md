I have probably seen a dozen or so type 4, and only one type 1 (aka 600xl) and maybe one or so of the others. The Type4 ones I have lasted forever and are rock solid. No warping bending. etc.. All the non-Type 4's I have always sink into the case (which is why some seem to have large rubber supports under them to press against the shield) or the switches themselves would start to break at their solder joints.
 
Great info Beetle, glad to see the differences explained in detail. I remember noticing the different keyboards on xl's back in the eighties, I wondered back then why the xl's sometimes looked slightly different.. I guess i was used to seeing mass produced non variant home computers in the other platforms .. I must say, apart from the xl's i'm repairing now (which were badly treated) i've not seen an xl with a bad keyboard before.

I just got my first 800XL after wanting one for 23 years (my friend had one in 1984). When I got it, I was surprised that the keys had a rough surface because I didn't remember them being that rough. Now I know it's a "type 4" and my friend's 800XL must have had a different keyboard.
 
Although the feedback on the XE KB's wasn't very good, at least there was very little chance of anything going wrong with the KB (that's if you replaced the KB resistor that come's as standard with the XE with the correct value one, either that or replace the XE kb MEMBRANE after 12 months use or the contacts will corrode or oxidise
 
I didn't like the XL kb's because they could easily get cracked at the back after prolonged use, I know, it happened to me and at the time when the likes of silica and other shops where asking 50 GBP for a replacement XL KB, luckily i spotted a cheap 800xl going at the PC/PCW show for about 20/30 pound (KB was OK)
 
I remember having to fix my first XE keyboard which I bought new when they came out. After using it for about 6 months, I remember having to replace 6 or 7 or 8 resistors (seems like they might have been pull-ups or downs?? can't remember) to keep it from missing keystrokes.
 
It would be interesting to know the dates when each of these keyboards was released. Usually, the first release of anything is the best quality, the second is similar quality but bugs or potential problems are fixed, then each successive release is a cost cutting measure to the final "ultra-crap because we don't give a shit anymore".
 
I just got an 800XL with a "type 1" keyboard from B&C. I thought "type 1" would be an early version - being considered "the best" - but it looks like a later one judging by the cheaper, thinner plastic. It is a good XL keyboard, but the keys look and feel a bit cheap. I bet it was released after the "type 4". The "type 2" must be the first one made - based on the pictures of the 800XL before it was released.
 
I'd like to see a listing of the different 800XL case and motherboard revisions. The B&C 800XL I just got has a horrible cheap-looking case. The plastic quality is much cheaper than my other two 800XLs and the motherboard and RF shield are different.

Wow. Excellent thread, thanks for bumping it. I was totally unaware that there were these variations, I just assumed type-4 was it. I'm going to have to keep my eyes open for a parts XL with a different keyboard since my type-4 has been a constant pain in the butt.
 
The oxidized Mylar can be resurrected most of the time by cleaning it with a product called "Goo Gone" (Usually available at your local Dollar store). I have used it to bring several of them back. I just get an old T-Shirt and soak a small part of it with the goo gone. rub it on the oxidized Mylar and leave it for about 5 minutes. then I use a green dish scrubber, put some goo gone on it and scrub the Mylar with it (not too hard just a moderate amount of pressure). this usually takes the oxidation off and Voila! It works. =)
 
I'd like to know about this modification, too. One of my XEs has a brand new keyboard, while the other has one which I had to painstakingly fix using conductive paint on the broken/oxidized traces. Both work now, and I'd like to keep them that way.
 
It seems there are also variations among the different "types". I've got two "type 4" keyboards - both revision 3A. The one in my main 800XL (revision 1A motherboard) has an annoying blocking problem on the large shift key. The other one - in an (unfortunately dead) 800XL with a Revision 2A motherboard - doesn't have that problem and the keys are a slightly darker brown. (so I swapped the keyboards so my good 800XL has the good keyboard)
 
Mega-bump. Been chatting about XL keyboards and was referred to this thread. I've got (actually fitted, since I had plenty to choose from) type 4 keyboard in my two "best" XLs, since I like the rigidity of the board, the heavy feel, and the looks. I was alarmed to read about the oxidisation issue, though, as well as the shift key sticking. I haven't experienced either of those issues yet, although both keyboards are in excellent condition and have received little use. It was a toss-up between type 4 and type 3 for me: unfortunately at least on of my type 1 keyboards was sacrificed for a 1064 conversion.
 
The switches have a habit of failing on both, I found, but they're easily replaced if you have a spare. I must admit I prefer that to having to replace a whole sheet of traces or faff about with a conductive pen.
 
The specially designed 8BitDo Dual Super Buttons offer large, programmable keys. Set macros to theSuper Buttons, or map anything to them instantly without using software. Connect up to 4 sets (1 setincluded).
 
EDIT:the keycaps are OG POM dyesubs I believe, with GMK Crimson cadet space bars and a few cozcaps gamer kit keys thrown in to finish the primary color scheme.

This is the deluxe keyboard option for The 8-Bit Guy's upcoming Commander X16 microcomputer. Realised by the Commander X16 design team in association with Chloe Corporation, it features 87 keys, PETSCII graphics on the keycaps, a bold retro style, and USB & PS/2 support out of the box. Use it with a modern computer running the Commander X16 (or other) emulator, or connect it directly to the Commander X16 computer via PS/2. Enjoy the trip down nostalgia lane and into the future with the Commander X16 deluxe keyboard.
 
**\*\*Please note;** While the hardware of this keyboard is V3 it uses a PS/2 adapter and will come with V2.5 firmware already flashed on the keyboard to enable the PS/2 connection. It is possible to upgrade to the V3 firmware to use the new V3 keyboard functions (such as macro programming, virtual layers, etc...) at a later date, however to use the PS/2 connection you will have to stay on the V2.5 firmware.
 
Nostalgia is one hell of a drug, and 8bitdo knows this very well. Their penchant for designing retro-fused gaming peripherals, such as the N30 Wireless Mouse or the M30 Wireless Gamepad, has been their modus operandi for quite some time now.
 
The 8bitdo Retro Mechanical Keyboard can be had in two different versions: the N Edition, which mimics the style and design of the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES), and the Fami Edition, which as the name would suggest is designed around the Famicom.
 
We received the N Edition, which personally of the two, I like the best. The attention to detail is what makes the keyboard so endearing. The top of the keyboard is the most striking, featuring a power bulb in the corner, two retro-style dials that manages connectivity and volume, and even the vertical stripes that were present on the NES. There are also three additional buttons, which handle pairing for Bluetooth connection, on-device key mapping and a profile button, each with an LED to indicate when they are in use.
 
All of that is tied with the overall aesthetics of gray, beige and bright, bold red on the PBT keycaps, and even the directional keys have received some love with large arrows printed on them. 8bitdo also throws in two B and A buttons and these can be customized to whatever functionality you like with the accompanying app.
 
The keyboard also comes with an accessory called the Super Buttons, a rectangular device with two large circular buttons that look like giant versions of the NES gamepad face buttons. It plugs into one of the four 3.5mm ports on the back (additional buttons can be bought separately for $19.99) and these buttons can be mapped separately to any command. I always wanted one of those giant mute buttons that you see on Tiktok and these Super Buttons fulfills that desire very well.
 
As mentioned before the N Edition Mechanical Keyboard supports wireless connections over Bluetooth and the 2.4Ghz USB dongle, but can also work as a wired USB keyboard when the need arises. According to 8bitdo, the battery can last for up to 200 hours of active use, which seems to be true as I have yet to need a recharge in my over two weeks of use. The reason the battery can last for so long is that the keyboard does not have any RGB whatsoever, which could be a deal breaker for some, but it would only ruin the aesthetics so I am completely fine with that.
 
**Update:**The 8bitdo Mechanical keyboard is now also available in a Commodore C64 or 'C64' version which, as expected, mimics the color and style of the classic console. It features the same dials and power bulb in the corners like the N Edition, as well as a stylish multi-color band in the middle with the 8bitdo branding super-imposed on top of it.
