As a result all enabled plugins (e.g. Silverlight/Flash) stay at the same version and do not get any security fixes. This might be a security thread for your system and we therefore recommend to remove Pipelight using the package manager of your distribution.

While the latest change to the stable branch was "Update of Silverlight to version 5.1.50901.0", I need it just for installing the "Unity web player" which wouldn't install in my Ubuntu 16.10 O.S., so I can't consider no more Pipelight as a solution for Linux distros.
 
If the webplayer has installed correctly, and your machine is capable of playing Unity content, then you should see the demos running in your browser, and other games should run also. If you do not see the demos running, please send us an email to support@unity3d.com, telling in as much detail as possible what happens at each of the steps above.

Many Unity webplayer games make use of Javascript hosting scripts called UnityObject.js or UnityObject2.js. These scripts are responsible for checking whether the webplayer is installed, and placing it into the webpage. If any scripting errors happen in any other Javascript on the page (perhaps analytics or tracking scripts) this can prevent Javascript from running. In turn, this can leave a message displayed saying the webplayer is not installed. This message comes from the HTML element. If UnityObject.js or UnityObject2.js runs correctly and the gamer has the webplayer installed, then this div is hidden.
 
On a PC, the webplayer installer installs only the Plugin component. The Player and Mono components are fetched on demand when the Plugin is first asked to play content. So, installing the web player plugin and disconnecting from the internet will leave the plugin unable to fetch these two critical components. This can result in a failure message. Visiting the webplayer page should show which versions of these components are installed. Note that Unity Engine means the player. These components are installed by default to c:\Users\you\AppData\LocalLow\Unity\WebPlayer where you means your username. If you look at this location you will see three folders, with the contents of loader being the plugin itself. If your plugin has not downloaded Mono and Player then you will miss folders called mono and player.
 
**Note:** The webplayer can be installed into c:\Program Files\ if the installer is run from a command prompt and given the /AllUsers flag. You need to be an Admin user to perform this task.
 
On a Mac, the installer will install all 3 components, so the web player is ready to play content immediately after the install finishes. The plugin can be found at /Library/Internet Plug-Ins/Unity Web Player.plugin, and Mono and the Player will be in the /Library/Internet Plug-Ins/Unity Web Player.plugin/Contents/Frameworks folder.
 
If you do not already have the FMOD Integration in your project, Assets/Plugins/FMOD is the base folder for the plugin and the dlls should be in Assets/Plugins/FMOD/lib. Otherwise if you are updating FMOD from a newer .unitypackage, it will find replace the files it finds (using the meta files data) without changing their current location.
 
It's not practical for us to convert our app to linear color space at this time. Is there a timeline for gamma color space support in Unity with OpenXR? Is it intended to only ever support linear color space? Any potential workaround for this? We are using OpenXR on other platforms, so we're not enthusiastic about moving to non-OpenXR options on Oculus.
 
Well, we ended up putting in the work to upgrade to Unity 2021. We're using the Vulkan renderer, which works in Gamma color space. Still on Oculus XR plugin version 1.11.2, from the package manager inside Unity. So it all works, and the Unity upgrade was pretty easy for our project this time.
 
I forgot to mention. We're using Unity 2020.3.31f1 and the recommended Oculus XR plugin from the package manager, which is Version 1.11.2. It's hard to make sense of this, but I think that corresponds with "v33" on the Oculus site.
 
Hey, have you gotten any farther with this? I'm trying to see if there is a sneaky way to use Gamma color space with the latest OpenXR backends. I'm still using com.unity.xr.oculus 1.11.2 to keep it working. Very frustrating for us as Linear space imposes a not-insignificant frame rate hit.
 
We are using Gamma space on all our platforms now, and it's working nicely. MSAA also works on all platforms- there were some combinations of MSAA where it doesn't work. We're using Vulkan on Quest, and that was a nice boost.
 
I don't recall when we moved from "Oculus XR plugin version 1.11.2" to what now seems to be 3.2.2. We've got a mid-sized project, and I remember both the unity upgrade and the oculus xr plugin upgrade being easier than expected.
 
Interesting. So, if I use OpenGL and if I upgrade to 3.2.2 it won't let me build because of the color space issue. Are you suggesting that I can get around this by switching to Vulkan? And you've seen a little performance improvement with Vulkan, huh? About to try it!
 
Yes, definitely move to Vulkan if possible. We're stuck on OpenGL on Pico because the headset doesn't support it... and on older versions of Unity we ran into bugs with Vulkan. Or unsupported features. It will depend on your render pipeline choice as well, unfortunately. The landscape changes quickly since it seems like there can be separate issues in different versions of each VR platform's plugin, each unity version, each unity render pipeline version, etc. My memory is a bit fuzzy, but there were render-backend specific issues with MSAA, other antialiasing options, and also full screen effects in VR.
 
I'm trying to do the same thing, but it won't let me build. I'm still getting "Oculus Utilities Plugin with OpenXR only supports linear lighting. Please set 'Rendering/Color Space' to 'Linear' in Player Settings" even though I'm using Vulkan. Did you manually remove the check in in OVRGradleGeneration.cs or something?
 
That does sound like something I'd do, but I took a look at the project, and I don't have a OVRGradleGeneration.cs file anywher ein the project. The only Oculus plugin we have is via the package manager, and it's "com.unity.xr.oculus" version 3.2.2. I don't see anything labeled Oculus Utilities Plugin, but it sounds familiar... so I'm wondering if you've also got an older plugin installed too, or some extra utilities.
 
I have installed the unity web player for chrome but the game face creator still says I have to download and install it. I've tried to do a lot of different things to get it to work but I'm stuck. Any ideas?
 
as of September 1st 2015, Chrome has blocked / stopped supporting all NPAPI type plugins which includes Unity 3D which is used to run the gameface plugin. You cannot run it on Chrome whatsoever, I too am getting the error where it thinks IE is Mozilla 11.
 
I'm new to both Unity and Android programming. My goal is to add some extra category specifiers to AppManifest.xml. As I understand it, to modify the manifest, I need to take Unity's generated manifest, copy it to my project to use as a starting point, then modify it.
 
Update: So I just took a look inside the generated APK file, and I see that it does include a class named com.unity3d.player.UnityPlayerActivity. I am not sure why it's looking for UnityPlayerActivity in my app's package instead of com.unity3d.player.
 
Ok, I got it working, I manually changed android:name in the application element from com.companyname.glass.screen.UnityPlayerActivity to com.unity3d.player.UnityPlayerActivity. But I'm not going to attempt to post a self-answer because I have no idea why I had to do that or if that was the "proper" solution. Will accept any reasonable explanation of this. (I arrived at this conclusion by comparing the manifests from the APKs both with and without my custom manifest; I do not understand why Unity filled in an incorrect application class name with "Export" vs "Build and Run").
 
This quickstart helps you install the Party SDK for Unity and make your first API calls to join players together in a Party Network. Before continuing, make sure you have completed Enable Party feature via Game Manager from your PlayFab account.
 
If you intend to use this plugin to develop games based on the Microsoft Game Development Kit (GDK) you need to acquire and install the GDK separately. Please also see details about Unity add-on for Game Core on Xbox consoles.
 
An installed copy of the Unity Editor. To install Unity for personal use via Unity Hub, or Unity+ for professional use, see Download Unity. Check on Unity support in documentation of your specific platform if needed. The minimum supported Unity version is Unity 2017 LTS.
 
Before you can create a network, you **must have a PlayFab player logged in**. For information about logging in a player, see Making your first API call in Quickstart: PlayFab Client library for C# in Unity.
 
This part of the guide shows you how to Create and Join a network with custom peer connectivity configuration options. The defaultoption is P2P, however, using any combination of the flags presented here: DirectPeerConnectivityOptions, the user can modify this option. This example shows how P2P is set:
 
Some platforms support temporarily suspending execution of your title: iOS, Switch, and GDK.When your title is suspended, the network stack becomes invalidated and PlayFab Party is unable to maintain a connection to the PlayFab Party network.Special consideration is required to handle suspending and resuming execution of your title when using PlayFab Party.
 
On Nintendo Switch and Microsoft GDK, you must clean up PlayFab
