Meanwhile, other fighting games were complete from the get-go and reaffirmed my love for good, modern fighters. If ever there was a game that needed to do a lot to impress me and win me back, it was Street Fighter 6. Nonetheless, for all that is dragon punches and footsies, the mad geniuses did it. On its continuing streak of great games, Capcom has brought one of their crown jewels back and reforged it into something altogether incredible - a proper return to marquee fighting game greatness for the franchise.

Of course, Street Fighter is about taking those moves and working opponents over with them, and there are tons of ways in which to do that in Street Fighter 6 as well. One-on-one and versus modes are here, as are extreme rules and gimmick modes. If you want to have a 3-on-3 bout with bulls sporadically running through the screen, you can. If you want to just have a typical match, you also can. There's also the option to take your favorite character against the CPU in an adjustable arcade Story mode. There, you can also put on modifiers like overall match count; round, time, and difficulty settings; and plenty more. Simply put, even if you just want to play vanilla-style Street Fighter, this game offers a lot of ways to play.

It's only good on solo as you are flanked in 95% of fights then. Works good with Fighter and Cleave Stance. 

But it's not really a strong subclass, though i combos quite well on solo with other classes.

im almost through my first run and im really really glad eder isnt able to go streetfighter as a swashbuckler. the deeper i got into the game, the easier it got, enemies die left an right and barely manage to group around eder before they die. hes never below 50% hp and flanking is rare.
 
You can trigger flanked on yourself with the blunderbuss modal. I'm currently doing a PotD run with a Streetfighter/Barbarian with double blunderbusses and its working well. If you're not into using guns, I think if you multiclass Streetfighter with Monk you can activate bloodied easily, but having not played much Monk I don't know the specifics. Using both the blunderbuss and monk multiclass you could activate both parts of the passive, which seems like it must be pretty good (nevermind that monk is OP anyways).
 
The Blunderbuss trick works great, built a gimmick toon (with Devoted, multiclass) that way myself. The -20% ? from the class, ends up turning into a permanent +30% (with the 50% from Distracted, which makes you flanked), and if you get your HP low enough to trigger the other part (Bloodied?) its insanely fast. Only thing you really have to watch out for, the Blunderbuss Modal will Friendly Fire your other team mates who are trying to melee whoever you're shooting at.
 
I know the actual broken part is the Brilliant Inspiration, but a Streetfighter with permanent Barring Death's Door & 50 deflection from Enduring Shadows / Shadowing Beyond is a great conduit for it. Kill safely On the Edge.
 
I gotta be honest, I've bounced off of a fair few 2D fighters in my life. I'm a 3D fighter girl at heart, and losing a dimension seriously messes with my head. What do you mean I can't sidestep? I gotta jump around? Unheard of. I've been determined to finally push past my fear of only having deux dimensions with Street Fighter 6 though, and by god does Capcom do a fantastic job of welcoming me inside, making me a nice cup of tea and patting me on the back just for showing up and trying.
 
It's a far cry from the much-maligned launch of Street Fighter 5, a grave error that's lingered around Capcom like a questionable fart for the last seven years. The developer slowly amended its mistakes, but it's certainly determined not to repeat them this time around. It's succeeded: Street Fighter 6 is a bombastic, colourful, all-out package that is ready to cater to every playstyle and skill level, doing it with a degree of finesse that has well and truly set the bar high for the next generation of fighting games.
 
It's hard not to fall in love with Street Fighter 6, for how much it offers and how easy it is to jump straight into any of its modes. I decided to start out in World Tour, its singleplayer mode that blends its core fighting gameplay with an open-ish RPG world, levelling system and story.
 
Fighting games have never been known for their thrilling singleplayer modes (unless you're Mortal Kombat), but World Tour is a pleasure to play through. Instead of playing as one of the game's classic fighters, I'm given the freedom to create my own abomination of an avatar. The character creator is seriously robust, with a staggering number of sliders and options to tweak. Want gigantic forearms and twig-like biceps? Street Fighter 6 has got your back. Want to look like a cat when it's standing on its hind legs? You can do that, too. I'm boring and opt for a relatively normal-looking approximation of my Final Fantasy 14 character, just with more muscles and a bigger dump truck. Things like limb length and body size actually factor into my ability to dish out and take damage, too, something I have to keep in mind when designing my beefcake OC.
 
I switch between "Masters," which grants me that fighter's normals and combos, but can mix in special and super moves I've picked up from other members of the roster, like throwing in Manon's command grab and Dhalsim's slippery teleport. I had far too much fun Frankensteining my own moveset, seeing just how goofy or weirdly optimized I could make my combo of different fighting styles. I could unlock even more moves by playing with each fighter's style and levelling it up, as well as plying each character with gifts picked up from merchants and beefing with random pedestrians and police officers. I can even take the moves and use them as platforming tools, like using Chun-Li's Spinning Bird Kick to levitate across two platforms, Luke's Rising Uppercut to throw myself up a ledge or Blanka's Electric Thunder to shock open barrels and crates for loot.
 
There are even part-time jobs, minigames that give me precious currency for outfitting my avatar or buying gifts for my pals, but once again masquerade as fun ways to teach fighting game fundies. I'm too embarrassed to admit how much of my playtime was spent on Hado-Pizza, a minigame dedicated to practicing input execution, which screams "Buono! Buono! Buono!" at me every time I do a good job. Other minigames focus on spacing and footsies, or dealing big damage and combos all at once.
 
It's a huge bummer because World Tour is a surprisingly enthralling fighter-slash-RPG hybrid outside of its technical issues. I spent around 60% of my 50-hour playthrough there, and while the performance issues didn't completely ruin my time with the mode, they certainly hampered it.
 
I played through the majority of World Tour with Street Fighter's new Modern controls, a more streamlined version of its classic control scheme. It takes the six-button input down to just four face buttons, simplifying special moves and adding the ability to string together auto combos with one button. It's a relatively simple control type on the surface, but contains a surprising amount of depth with the option to manually input certain moves. It's a great starting point for those who are unfamiliar or easily overwhelmed by Street Fighter's traditional inputs, and makes up for its increased simplicity by reducing damage on specials and providing somewhat suboptimal combo routes.
 
Some are unhappy about the inclusion of Modern controls and its allowance in online mode, but I see it as a great way to introduce people to fighting games. Classic control users will still be able to best less skilled players relying on Modern controls, and those who decide to stick around will inevitably upgrade to the full-blown Classic control scheme eventually.
 
Modern controls also served as a way to help me get to grips with some of the more complex characters, like sinister zoner JP. He's one of my favourite fighting game newcomers in a while, but his high level of technicality was an instant roadblock. Being able to quickly pick him up and get a feel for him in Modern controls made me want to explore his movelist further in Classic, something I think will be the case for many others.
 
That's mostly what I did, too. I tinkered around a lot with Chun-Li, Marisa and Kimberly's movesets during my time with World Tour, and I was desperate to learn more about what they do and, and which of their moves are most useful. That's when I moved to Fighting Ground, which houses most of Street Fighter 6's offline modes: Arcade, tutorials, versus mode and team battles.
 
Unfortunately, the commentary gets a touch repetitive. Hearing "Wow, what a decision!" for the thousandth time made me question my sanity at one point. It was never going to imitate live hyped-up commentary perfectly, but it does feel rather stagnant when I'm wailing on CPUs. However, I did find it surprisingly useful for getting a read on what I was doing right and wrong in the moment. That instant feedback isn't something you usually get out of these games, and so surprisingly, the fake commentary is actually useful.
