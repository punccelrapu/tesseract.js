A 3D roaming fighter, where you take control of iconic Dragon Ball characters and duke it out in destructible environments ripped straight out of the anime. Now the series is returning to its original Japanese name, Sparking!, a reference to the lyrics from the original opening, Cha-La-Head-Cha-La.

The Budokai Tenkaichi series includes a vast number of features that have us coming back to these games years later. Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero continues from Budokai Tenkaichi 3, so we hope to experience familiar and new features that will keep us playing for hours, like if it were 2007.
 
The Create-A-Character is not a new feature for a Dragon Ball game, but it could be newly introduced to the Sparking! series. This feature has been included in Dragon Ball: Ultimate Tenkaichi and the Xenoverse series.

For Sparking! Zero, character creation can act similarly to the Xenoverse games, where we are able to equip clothes, skills, techniques, and transformations from other existing fighters. We will be able to find these items throughout the story mode and purchase them with Z-points, in-game currency for most DBZ games.
 
The second Budokai Tenkaichi implemented a very detailed story mode compared to the third game in this series, which had us play scenarios of famous Dragon Ball battles with static cutscenes and limited interaction between characters.
 
Sparking! Zero should follow Budokai Tenkaichi 2, which contained the best story mode that gave us most of the major arks of Dragon Ball from beginning to end. It can be adapted into this game's engine through cutscenes and battles with the AI-operated characters.
 
It's a no-brainer to include a tournament mode in a Budokai Tenkaichi game, but now it can take place online. Online games have evolved since 2007, now providing a smooth and responsive experience when facing a large number of players.
 
The lobby can contain many fighters facing their own matches at the same time, and if the match is finished quickly, then the victor will wait till his next opponent is ready. Dragon Ball includes many tournaments throughout the series, but Sparking! Zero can include the World Martial Arts, Other-World Tournament, and The Cell Games.
 
In the anime, the Tournament of Power was a multi-universal tournament that pitted the strongest warriors from each of the eight universes to save their universe from extinction. There's a reason why the Tournament of Power was left out of the online tournaments in entries in the series, as it deserves a separate mode with an expansive arena where 30 fighters fight each other until there is only one fighter left.
 
A battle royale mode will modernize this series and won't alienate players as it will exist as its own mode with its own set of rules. Fights will play mostly like the base game, but they will require slightly modified controls such as a lock-on feature added to a fighter's repertoire. The expansive battlefield will close in as the match drags out.
 
This might be a hot take, but we need accurate fusions where fighters have a limited time for their fusion. We would also have to bring back the button inputs when performing a fusion, straight out from Dragon Ball: Budokai 3. If the inputs are wrong, then the fusion will come out imperfect.
 
During team battles, the two characters will join health bars, but once the fusion is over, and they have taken damage, then both characters will lose health. This feature will make us use our fusion wisely during a fight, whether it be against an online or AI opponent.
 
A popular mode from Dragon Ball games is the What-If saga, where we take control of characters and insert them into made-up scenarios, such as the Sayians uniting to stop Frieza before he blows up Planet Vegeta, Broly and Vegeta reaching Super Sayian 3, and Kid Goku meeting Arale.
 
In past Dragon Ball games, we had a few options when customizing a fighter. For Budokai Tenkaichi 3's Evolution-Z, we were able to improve character stats and abilities, such as attack, health, and defense.
 
This mode would also be evolved in Sparking! Zero, where we can also customize the colors of existing fighters. Sure, it is nice to have preset outfits that reference certain battle characters are a part of, but having the extra option to change color elements to those costumes would give us a better attachment to our customs.
 
The Dragon Balls have been included in many games, often granting you bonuses when all seven are collected. Dragon Ball Fighterz had opponents collect them simultaneously in order to buff their stats within a match. In Budokai Tenkaichi 3, the dragon balls are hidden in the destructible environment during the story mode.
 
With all seven collected, you can select a new mode that grants you one or three wishes with Shenron or Porunga. These wishes included numerous Zeni, enhancements, stages, and characters, such as Future Gohan. In. Sparking! Zero, this mechanic can follow the same rules as BT3, but it can also include the Super Dragon Balls, which will contain rare characters or outfits.
 
In Dragon Ball: Tenkaichi Tag-Team for the PSP, we were able to fight alongside a partner against our opponents in the style of the Budokai Tenkaichi games. Overall, the game worked by having a lock-on feature that lets us switch our targets, offering a smooth combat experience.
 
The world map of the Dragon Ball universe has been included in many games, but Budokai Tenkaichi 2 had us take control of characters and travel on a world map that bridged battles from the beginning of Dragon Ball Z to the end of the Buu saga.
 
In the world map, you can stray away from the next battle and explore the land to arrive at a city and talk to an NPC or collect items. Granted, the map was very limited to where you can land and interact with, but it can be a basis for a more expansive world in Sparking! Zero that includes well-known locations, finding collectibles, and interacting with NPCs that can conclude in a fight.
