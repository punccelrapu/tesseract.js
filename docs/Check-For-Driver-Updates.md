Device drivers are software that allow your computer to communicate with hardware components. These include your printer, graphics card, and more. Updating drivers ensures your hardware functions properly and takes advantage of new features and security updates.
 
Although this program limits the number of downloads you can perform per day, you can still check for outdated drivers as often as you want. You're just limited when it comes to downloading them. I talk more in the review about why this isn't as bad of a limit as it might sound.
 
I found a program This program lists all the drivers on your computer that lists all the drivers and their company. 184 out of the 215 drivers are Microsoft drivers, so I am **assuming** that these get updated via Windows Update. But the remaining 31 drivers are up to the user to maintain and keep up to date.

I am wondering if there is a capable and praised application, or convenient "superuser" type method out there, that looks at all the hardware and drivers and checks to see if there is an updated version for them, and points/provides the link to the drivers download. Besides that, the only way I know is to try googling the driver, looking for the operating system specific version of it, and seeing if the most recent version is higher than my installed version. This is tedious, and is not something that can be kept up with daily. Therefore, from my knowledge,there is no way to know exactly when a new driver update comes out, until I do the google check, which could be days weeks after the update came out.
 
Microsoft's Windows Update is generally the best method for keeping drivers up to date. There are some caveats though. With drivers that are updated often, like video drivers, the manufacturers do not submit the drivers to MS for WHQL certification often, and therefore do not get updated by Windows Update. This means the "up to date" driver you received from Windows update is the latest Microsoft certified driver, not the latest from the manufacturer. AMD, NVidia, and other manufacturers that update their drivers often, have their own driver update software that you can use to keep their drivers up to date. If a manufacturer has their own driver updater, its best to use that, or just check their sites.
 
I stay away from 3rd party driver updaters. Some are outright malware, while others may work, but you do not know if their sources are correct or up to date. I have seen some 3rd party updates incorrectly detect a device and install the wrong drivers. This can be a PIA to fix. IMO, 3rd party device drivers software is not worth the headaches.
 
I have three month old R10. When I check online at Dell.com support, and choose "let Dell automatically find Driver updates for you", it says that I am up to date and no driver updates are available. If I go check driver updates and downloads manually I see a driver update flagged with "this PC" urgent status, relating to a 3090 video card driver update released end of July addressing an NVIDIA security bulletin. The driver identification appears specific to Dell, ie does not seem to correspond to an NVIDIA driver number that I would find on the the NVIDIA website, so I cannot tell if it corresponds to a recent NVIDIA driver update released by NVIDIA.
 
So I am not sure if I need to download and install this driver. If I need it and it is urgent why does it not show up when I choose to have Dell automatically check for me? I am using the video card driver that came with the PC when it was delivered back in May 2021.
 
The support assist function should by default find and install all recommended updates automatically from Dell (without any action on your part). Unless you opt out of it or removed it from your system, that is. It isn't necessary to manually search or go to dell.com to update the drivers.
 
But I guess I am also wondering whether the drivers/downloads automatic search will reliably find needed updates, and whether just manually finding one on the list that seems urgent and applying it is a good idea, since I am assuming the automatic search uses my very specific system configuration to determine what drivers are compatible and needed.
 
Under 'Manually Find Drivers' I currently see 6 'URGENT' updates for "This Device" with my service tag, but support assist says everything is up to date. So I guess I don't need these URGENT updates...
 
EDIT: How the heck do you reply to private messages? Every time I try it says I have invalid characters in my reply and it removed them - so I hit send again and it says "You have reached the limit for number of private messages that you can send for now. Please try again later." And I have yet to send a single private message! @##!@#@ I must have a setting set wrong or something...
 
AMD Radeon Settings displays information about the current driver installed in the system. It also provides a quick and easy method to check if a new driver is available. This article provides step by step guidance on finding the current driver version and how to check if a new driver is available.
 
**NOTE**! A Recommended driver has a collection of performance enhancements and fixes which have passed extensive internal quality assessments and has received the Microsoft Windows Hardware Quality Labs (WHQL) certification. An Optional driver provides the latest support for new game titles and graphics products that launch between recommended driver releases.
 
I haven't dug into it too much so whenever it pops up and tells me my computer is not feeling well........lol I just check make it feel better. So are you saying when that happens just ignore it, close that screen and open Ccleaner and go to the custom clean page? or by setting the home screen to custom clean the health screen won't pop up anymore? instead the custom clean screen will?
 
I guess that you're asking this because v6.09 has just added 50 more apps that it can update, so some people will now be seeing software updates in Health Check when they didn't before.
 -v6-09-10300
 
**1- Use Custom Clean.**
Go to Options>Settings and change the CCleaner Home Screen to Custom Clean. It will then show you Custom Clean when you open CCleaner.
You get more control of what gets cleaned or not by ticking/unticking the categories, be careful you do really want to tick extra things to clean because Custom Clean can clean things that Health Check wouldn't touch.
 
**2- Tell Health Check to ignore what it has found to update.**
If you do want to use Health Check then:
When it says it has found apps to update in the 'Security' box click on that box.
Untick any apps that you don't want updating, click 'Save and Back to Overview', and continue with 'Make it Better'.
YOU WILL HAVE TO DO THAT EVERYTIME THAT YOU RUN HEALTH CHECK. It doesn't remember that you told it to ignore them so will try to update them next time.
 
yes my Ccleaner updated to the latest version, when I saw the heath check screen on my computer it also started to popup programs that I own and said there were updates. I dind't realize it was Ccleaner doing it I thought it was the programs I had just rebooted. long story short, there were only 2 but I thought the popup was from the program so I clicked update and it installed newer versions that I chose not to upgrade to and pay for. I had to uninstall them and reinstall the older ones I own.
 
Health Check was originally introduced as an option for those non-techie people who just want a quick clean of the 'regular' stuff without bothering about changing settings.
It was originally called 'Quick Clean' / 'Easy Clean.
When they added the automatic Startup app cleaning (Speed) and automatic Software Updating (Security) for pro it was renamed Health Check.
Those 2 features were already there in Tools and they still are, they only run if you choose to run them.
 
In my personal opinion they only added those two functions in Health Check so that they had 'something extra' to temp those non-techie people to buy Pro.
(Even though they probably don't want those 2 features anyway).
 
Keeping your drivers up to date may be a pain, but it's something we all have to do. It's not always clear how to update your drivers, especially for those without a good base in IT knowledge, and with all those site out there just waiting to deploy malicious software with genuine Nvidia signature codes. But there is a right way to ago about updating drivers, to ensure a smooth update process.
 
This guide will give you the tools you need to confidently update the most common types of drivers, and even includes some general tips for dealing with any issues that may arise. This guide is geared towards gaming PCs, but most of it applies to any Windows computer.
 
If your PC has an Nvidia GeForce graphics card, you definitely want to keep the drivers updated. New releases often include performance enhancements for new games, or fixes for issues caused by Windows updates.
 
There used to be a tool called Nvidia Update located in the Nvidia control panel, but with the advent of GeForce Experience, that option has been removed. The Nvidia control panel is still installed automatically when you set up Nvidia's drivers, but you'll need to update the drivers through GeForce Experience or manually download and install the driver from Nvidia's website.
