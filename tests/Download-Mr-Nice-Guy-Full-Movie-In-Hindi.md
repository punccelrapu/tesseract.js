**be nice.** is a program with a four-step action plan that's proven to save lives. Under the leadership of Executive Director Christy Buck, the Foundation enlisted Grand Valley State University researchers to conduct an evidence-based study to prove the effectiveness of the program. Results concluded the **be nice.** program creates a positive culture, increases mental health referrals, and increases behaviors that prevent suicide.
 
When used effectively, the **be nice.** action plan - to notice, invite, challenge, and empower - encourages individuals to challenge themselves and others to seek appropriate professional help when they notice mental health changes or concerns. This program equips individuals in schools, businesses, faith institutions, and communities with the knowledge and confidence to take action when it comes to mental health and suicide prevention.

OMG, what a gem!! Most eclectic creative pizza/food/cocktail menu I've encountered so far in Fort Myers/Cape Coral. I don't know what it is about some of these places in the Cape, they are passionate about their booze. Passionate about their food, reminds me of the science mixologist food/chefs of Portland. The place is gothic, funky, clean-grungy vibe, loved it. Will definitely come back. Only had the Hummus ( very tasty) and a drink, a cucumber lime rosemary gin concoction that was bomb! Can't wait to try their dynamic, creative and explosive menu, which also offer GF crust and healthier options. Xoxo
 
We have heard great things about this place and it has been on our list for a while. Here we go finally. We ordered a couple cocktails to start with. I love my butter beer. It was topped with homemade whipped cream which gave a good contrast with the nitro beer on the bottom. We are not Vegan but my fiance was curious so he ordered the vegan cheese sticks. And it is very good that you can't tell the difference. We had a half and half pizza: black truffle oil and black garlic. Their combination of toppings are nontraditional and unique. We will definitely come back.
 
Who would have thought I'd give a pizza place in Florida 5 stars. Went where with the bride to be and our mens before the wedding. We got a Big Mick Pizza and a General Tsos pizza with the garlic knots. The food was fantastic. The owner came and ensured everything was going well and was very friendly. I would eat those pizzas every day for the rest of my life if I could.

This pizza spot was such a tasty place to visit while visiting friends. As soon as you walk in, you feel like a young kid again with all the cool interior decor it has and the low shining lights. As far as the pizzas, they had different flavors to choose from, some that I have never seen before on pizza. We had the elote pizza, which was really good and had a big taste of corn. We also had the buffalo chicken pizza, I believe, and that was also delicious. Whenever we're in town visiting our friends, we always make it a point to visit nice guys!
