I've recently made the leap from an iPhone to a Samsung S23, and I'm trying to figure out how to transfer my WhatsApp data over to my new phone. We're talking years of messages, photos, and videos here, and the thought of losing any of it is freaking me out. I've scoured the internet for a foolproof method but ended up more confused than when I started. Everything from Whatsapp chats that mean the world to me, to photos and videos that are irreplaceable - I need to get them all safely across to my S23. Your expertise and advice would be a lifesaver right now!
 
Finally, it's always a good idea to perform a manual backup of your Samsung S23 WhatsApp data after the transfer to ensure that your data is up to date and secure. You can do this by going to WhatsApp > Settings > Chats > Chat Backup > Back Up Now.
 
If you only need to save certain important chats, WhatsApp allows you to email individual chat histories to yourself. You won't be able to restore these chats into WhatsApp on your new phone, but you'll have them as a record in your email.
 
Are you planning to switch from iPhone to Samsung device like Galaxy S23 but worried about transferring your valuable WhatsApp data? Well, worry no more! In this article, we will guide you how to **transfer WhatsApp data from iPhone to Samsung device seamlessly**.

If you are already using WhatsApp on your Samsung phone, the Smart Switch will not be able to provide WhatsApp data transfer. Alternatively, you can choose the third-party **transfer tool** - iMyTrans.
 
Samsung Smart Switch is a powerful tool that allows you to transfer WhatsApp data such as chat logs, call logs, and contact profiles. It offers both wired and wireless transfer. If your WhatsApp takes up a lot of storage space, we recommend that you choose wired transfer for a more stable and secure data transfer rate:
 
Smart Switch allows you to transfer various data, including contacts, messages, photos, videos, and even applications from your iPhone to your Samsung device. However, please note that WhatsApp data can only be transferred if you have performed **a recent backup** on your iPhone.
 
Unfortunately, neither Smart Switch nor iMyTrans can directly transfer WhatsApp contacts. However, you don't need to worry as WhatsApp automatically syncs your contacts from your phone's address book. When you set up WhatsApp on your Samsung device, your contacts should be available.
 
You can use an app known as the WazzapMigrator to transfer WhatsApp messages from iPhone to your Samsung. However, some users complain that the chats are not fully transferred to the destination device, some of them are garbled or lost. Also, the process of this method might be a little complicated, it requires two third-party tools to finish.
 
**Step 4.** Launch the app and click on Select iPhone Archive and tap on the iPhone backup file.The app will convert the backup file into a format that Android can understand and you'll have your messages on the device in no time.
 
**Step 3.** Select the device you would like to transfer WhatsApp messages from (in this case the iPhone) and right-click on the Samsung device and select **Transfer Messages from iPhone to Android**. The program will immediately begin transferring the data to the device.
 
The methods mentioned in this article are specifically for transferring WhatsApp data from an iPhone to a Samsung device. However, you can explore similar options like Google Drive backup and restore or third-party applications designed for Android devices.
 
If the transfer process gets stuck or fails, make sure both devices are connected properly, and try restarting the applications or devices. If the issue persists, you can seek assistance from the respective support channels of Smart Switch or iMyTrans.
 
Transferring WhatsApp data from an iPhone to a Samsung device is a straightforward process with the right tools. Whether you're moving to a new Samsung device or an old one, you can rely on Samsung Smart Switch or iMyTrans to make the transfer seamless. Just remember to follow the steps carefully and ensure you have performed recent backups to avoid any data loss. Enjoy using WhatsApp on your new Samsung device!
 
Thanks for your response, the cloud backup option only works when staying on the same platform and is not supported when switching from Apple to Android as Android cannot access iCloud where the Whatsapp backup is stored.
 
I followed the official guide stated in this thread, the qr does appear and data transfers seems succesful up to the point where I should open WhatsApp and load the history by logging in with my phone number. It loads groups but the threads are empty.
 
I tried once more and this time I was successful. Did another factory reset and this time it worked. Unfortunately not sure why it did not work earlier but I did make sure the last time that there were no interruptions in the transfer. The only advise I have is to keep trying, make sure you disable the auto screen lock as wel as iPhones feature that sets time limits on apps.
 
The only thing that pops to mind are small interruptions during the process that causes whatsapp to close during the whole transfer. I once had whatsapp run into the maximum time limit that I had set earlier. Also definitely make sure your Iphone screen stays on all the time (turn off the option that locks the screen at inactivity)
Make sure your wifi is stable, that sort of things. I did a backup of all chats in txt format as well.
