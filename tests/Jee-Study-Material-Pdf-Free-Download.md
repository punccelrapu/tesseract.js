I've registered for the CGRC exam in March 2024. I've bought and read the Official (ISC)2 Guide to the CAP CBK 2nd Edition. The publisher information for the guide on Amazon says it was published in 2016, but the copyright notice in the book itself says 2013 (and a lot of the text uses terminology, examples, and references dating from the mid-2000s).
 
ISC2's web page for CGRC training includes a link for self study tools such as "official text books", "official study guides", and "official practice tests". But when I click on "Learn More", all I find are flashcards (I've downloaded these, but studying flashcards is not my preferred study method) and an online study group (which hardly seems like a self study option).

Greetings. Recently, @emb021 posted a good list of material on this thread. Largely, CGRC is covered by the standards created by NIST and ISO (leaning more heavily on the NIST material, by the way), so you should develop a strong familiarity with the Special Publications.
 
Thanks. I knew I was going to have to get into the NIST SPs, but I was hoping for some summary guides first. As for ISC2's suggested resources, it's out of date (it cites superseded versions of documents; the one cited summary guide is a decade old).
 
Is there no summary of what ISC2 considers the CBK to be so I have an idea what to focus on in the SPs? How much do I have to know about the ISO 27001 (which has been revised since the latest summary guide was published)?
 
l think studying NIST SP 800- 37 r2 couples of times should be enough because it covers all other publications required to pass the exams. You can also go to youtube and search for GRACESUFF IT SOLUTIONS, there is a summary of all the domains that will really help for the exams.

Hello everyone,

There is some study material on the training institute portal or here on the Fortinet support page regarding the configuration and functionality of a Fortigate used as an IDS/IPS probe.
I would like to learn more about this and the admin guides just tell you step by step how to enable or configure a certain function.

To help candidates prepare for the Financial Risk Manager (FRM) Exam, GARP provides study materials, practice exams, and information on approved, third-party exam preparation providers. The following official resources are available to help candidates prepare for both parts of the FRM Exam.
 
The FRM Learning Objectives document provides a comprehensive framework to guide candidates as they self-study for the FRM Exam. It contains a syllabus and approximate weightings for each of the broad knowledge domains covered by the Exam, specific curriculum readings associated with each knowledge area, and individual learning objectives for each reading. Since every FRM Exam question maps to at least one learning objective, the FRM Learning Objectives document is an important study resource and should be referred to regularly during exam preparation.
 
**Note:** FRM eBooks are non-refundable. Once you purchase, please follow the instructions to access them. Access is for three years online via web browser and two years offline via desktop or mobile applications. Limited printing is supported.
 
In addition to the information contained in the books, the FRM Exam covers a selection of material from leading academics and practitioners. These online readings are a required part of the FRM curriculum.
 
These additional readings contain the full texts of some Basel regulations covered in the FRM curriculum. While not required, these readings provide additional insights into the context and mechanics of the Basel regulations and are therefore highly recommended.
 
As you prepare, GARP will highlight modules that appear on the FRM Exam to help you pace yourself through the exam material. These modules directly correspond to the FRM Study Guide and to the related readings in the official FRM books.
 
Some candidates for the FRM Exam may wish to study the exam material with the assistance of an FRM exam preparation provider (EPP). EPPs may
