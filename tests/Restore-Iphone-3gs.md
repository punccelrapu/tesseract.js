Not long ago, an auto-update hit her phone (auto downloaded and installed), restarted, and in turn restarted Secure Enclave, asking for her 6 digit passcode (that those among the living can't seem to figure out)

Now I should probably mention at this point, I'm probably the most tech savvy person in my entire family, and I know when to stop, others in my family don't, and keep trying to "help", making matters worse, and downright refuse to listen to me. In this case, they just keep trying passcodes trying to find one that will work, now they did it one too many times and disabled the phone
 
My grandmother and I went to the Apple Store near her, and due to COVID-19 precautions, they won't even let us enter the store without an appointment, I schedule an appointment (which I was unable to honor) and left, at this point, we were trying to keep the data on her phone, so we were avoiding anything that would wipe it
 
While we were at the Apple Store, the guy said if we were willing to wipe the data (which we didn't at the time), we could restore it by plugging it into a (any) computer and restarting it in restore mode, I mentioned that all available computers we have at the moment (not including my personal computers, which I don't have access to right now) were (Windows) PCs and don't have iTunes installed (and we will not be installing iTunes, or any other extra software, on them), he said "that is fine, it will work on Windows, and iTunes is no longer required, just plug in the iPhone to USB, restart in recovery mode and BAM, done, you have a factory reset iPhone"
 
Time goes by and my cousin (the deceased's daughter) takes our grandmother to the same Apple Store, and they say "oh, no problem, we can back that up" and they set up and appointment, they go to the appointment, see that the iPhone is disabled and go "Ooooh, its disabled, yeah we can't back that up", back to square one
 
I then, while using my phone, remembered that my phone was backed up to iCloud, I later found out that even my mother's iPhone was backed up to iCloud, and it hit me, what if my grandmother's iPhone is already backed up to iCloud? She wouldn't lose anything in a factory reset anyway, it would all be on iCloud at least, and we could eventually get into that

Anyway, we all decide to just factory reset the phone and erase everything, so I go back over, get her phone and go back to that Apple Store, which again they wont accept walk-ins due to COVID-19, so I planned an appointment for next week, but while discussing it, we figured I could just take her iPhone home with me and use one of the computers here
 
Here's the problem, nothing they said at the Apple Store seems to be true, I plugged the iPhone into a computer (with Windows 10) that doesn't have iTunes installed and is not currently connected to the internet (but according to the guy at the Apple Store, he never said an Internet connection was required), after getting the iPhone into recovery mode, it just gave me a URL to go to (support.apple.com/iphone/restore)
 
So I grab my Windows tablet I have available (also Windows 10, and also without iTunes, but is connected to the Internet) and with the iPhone in recovery mode and connected via USB to the tablet, I go to that URL, and read the only part that seems to pertain to what I am trying to do
 
If you are the owner of the iPhone or the owner has shared all information with you then to open **Activation Lock**:- If it is Activation locked, read here --> Turn off Activation Lock - Apple Support Activation Lock for iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch - Apple Support
 
If you are not the owner of the iPhone and do not have the Apple ID and Password then there is no way that you can get into this iPhone unless the original owner shares the Apple ID and password to you. If you are lucky you can get into this iPhone if they (owner) accidentally remove the device from their apple ID.
 
Even if I was willing to, I am limited to a desktop PC without Internet access (meaning I can't download iTunes, because it can't download anything), and a tablet with a full SSD, there's simply no room on it to install iTunes
 
My iPhone 5 got stuck at the iTunes screen so I connected it to iTunes and iTunes asked me to either update or restore. I tried update and it failed and restore failed as well. Both options take me through:
 
Santiago and AMB-- Were either of you ever able to recover?? I see this all over the internet, on Apple forums: ppl with this or a similar issue, but hardly anyone ever resolves the problem (or if they do, theres no way to know.)! I have the same EXACT issue, this frustrating Error 48, keeping me forever in Recovery Mode....just spent nearly $100 fixing a cracked screen and getting a nice case for it....and now, it won't let me Update, or Restore! Twenty eight folks hit the "me too" button on this thread; is there truly nothing that can be done?
 
I had the SAME issue last night. I tried all the steps, except updating iTunes. Then I read this thread this morning and followed every step as outlined. Completely solved! My iPhonology is back in order! I did not want to spend more effort and time on this issue. Thank you for your guidance. ?
 
Try a DFU restore. It looks different than Recovery Mode. You won't see anything on the display. Plug in your device to your computer and open iTunes. Hold the home button and sleep/wake button for 15 seconds. At the end of the 15 seconds, release the sleep/wake button but continue to hold the home button for another 10-12 seconds. You will get a popup window within iTunes telling you that the phone needs to be restored. If that doesn't work, a trip to an Apple Store or Apple Authorized Service Provider may be in order.
 
Nothing should be visible on the screen during a DFU restore. You do not want a DFU screen. Attempt the steps above again. This time, after you release the **Sleep/Wake**button, hold the **Home** button for only **9**seconds.
 
hey mate, I guess I may have figured it out. I was having the same problem, I tried hard reboot and restore, in the first go it got stuck, saying confirmation needed from phone, then I repeated the same process(hard reboot and restore) but without removing the cable, this time it got extracted and went bit forward, then stuck at verifying, then I did the same thing the third time, this time went bit forward and got stuck at apple logo, and showed progress bar(hope comes in), at the fourth repetition progress bar went to complete end and bingo it started restoring the factory setting.
 
Just now, I already fixed my god forsaken phone with the same problem, All I did is i quoted above, while pressing the home button and power button, every a couple of second, until the iphone finish filling up its loading bar on screen.
 
I purchased Reiboot based on a suggestion on this thread. reiboot's pro version didn't help. Reading on the internet, a few days back, I came across information that faulty chargers or lightning cable could ruin the charging system, which in turn would mean that even while the battery inside the iPhone is working fine, it won't charge.
 
I investigated my original apple lightning cables and also took a look inside the lighting port on the iPhone (6s plus, in my case) to see if there are any signs of burnout. What I found is that one of the cables (I have about 3/4 genuine ones and I dont use non-genuine ones), which I had connected to a transcend powered usb 3.0 hub had a black mark (almost like a small dot) exactly on one of the 8 connector 'pins'. Now, even the lightning port on the iPhone, had a similar blackish, burnt like, mark on the connector pin corresponding to the the pin on the cable, when looked at towards the side of the home button (upwards), where the port has the pins that connect to the pins on the lightning cable's socket.
 
I think this is either a case of a faulty chip inside the 6s plus which maybe causing over current or over voltage, or maybe some bad code in iOS11 which controls these chips, or could be a problem with either the lightning cable or the transcend hub.
 
Well, I think before going to somewhere else, you should do some homework that can help you to get out of the error you are coming across on your iPhone. I would like to give you few manual methods that works effectively to fix iPhone stuck at Verifying Update screen.
 
When you come across such error then its obvious thing that you cannot access your device as it get stucked. In this situation, try to do hard reset of your phone as this will help your device to work properly as before.
