When you are looking for an alternative to LGMT 2/0.4 SKF Bearing Grease, you should consider turbine lube oil vg 32-46. This product has several advantages over other types of grease that makes it more suitable for many different applications.
 
The first benefit that you will notice when using turbine lube oil vg 32-46 is that this product has a high viscosity index (VI). This means that it will remain stable at high temperatures without breaking down or separating from your equipment. This makes it perfect for use in many applications where there are extreme heat conditions or heavy loads being exerted on the bearings or seals within the system being lubricated by turbine lube oil vg 32-46.
 
Lithium complex greases are designed to lubricate rolling bearings in extreme temperatures and heavy load conditions. The Lithium complex formula resists water washout even under the most severe conditions. This makes them ideal for use in marine applications where there is high humidity or exposure to water spray.
 
Shell Gadus S2 V220 is a thermal-stable, non-toxic, synthetic grease designed for use in bearings operating under severe conditions. It is recommended for use in bearings that operate at temperatures above 221F (105C) and below 464F (240C), such as in rolling mills, steel plants, power stations and blast furnaces. Shell Gadus S2 V220 has a high consistency index to provide a stable grease film at high temperatures. It also has a low pour point to prevent formation of water films at low temperatures.
 
This is a special grease developed for use in high-speed lubricating grease applications. It has been tested by SKF and proven to have excellent performance in both dry and wet conditions. This grease is suitable for high-speed bearings operating under normal or heavy load conditions, such as machine tool spindles, conveyor belts and driveshafts. It can also be used in other applications requiring superior lubrication characteristics combined with resistance to water.
 
Klubersynth UH1 6-460 is a light grease that provides lubrication and rust protection in environments where special requirements must be met. It has a very low viscosity and is compatible with most materials. It is recommended for all types of bearings, gears and sliding surfaces, including those made from plastics.

Klubersynth UH1 6-460 is based on synthetic hydrocarbon oils and has been modified with corrosion inhibitors. This ensures that the grease will not become sticky or lose its lubricating properties when exposed to water or high humidity levels. Klubersynth UH1 6-460 also contains extreme pressure additives that provide protection against wear and corrosion caused by friction at high speed and temperature loads in industrial applications such as textile machinery, pumps and compressors, shipbuilding and construction equipment etc..
 
Caltex Synlube CLP 460 XP is a white lithium complex grease with an NLGI 2 grade (1mm penetration). It has an operating temperature range of -35C to 120C (-31F to 248F), maintains its viscosity over a wide temperature range and is compatible with most metals and elastomers.
 
The EP2/3 grease is a high viscosity, thick grease with a high load carrying capacity and excellent thermal stability. It contains no solids or water and can therefore be used in any position within the bearing, e.g., both sides of the bearing cone or both sides of the rolling element cage.
