Hi, 
So here is my problem. My father had problems on his computer so I lend him mine. He installed on my laptop a software called TX3 Configurator. By installing this software it also installed SQL Server.
 
Warning: pg\_connect(): Unable to connect to PostgreSQL server: could not connect to server: No such file or directory Is the server running locally and accepting connections on Unix domain socket "/var/run/postgresql/.s.PGSQL.5432"? in /home/dba\_man/simulator/site/db.php on line 18
 
**Can someone help me ?** I only use my laptop for basic stuff like school and games. Right now everything else seems to work, I only can't connect to the electude simulator ( a website i need to go on for school/learn )

PostgresSQL is a different product than SQL Server. They are the same kind of products - they are both relational database management systems, but they are entirely unrelated. And in this case, they are not even on the same machine.
 
If you want to uninstall SQL Server from your machine, you can right-click and select uninstall. There may be remnants that you need to uninstall separately. However, this will not resolve the issue with the Electude simulator, which apparently is broken.
 
Somehow my iPhone Simulator is unable to play sounds. First an app I'm working on using AudioServicesPlaySystemSound() stopped working.. I spent a while debugging this but sound is still working on the iPhone when I run the app on the device. I get the same results with other iPhone apps such as the sample Crash Landing app.
 
I've found sound to be very inconsistent in the simulator (2.1 SDK). Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. Even when it does work, it's usually very choppy and distorted (when playing audio files such as mp3).
 
somehow after a few days, my iphone simulator now wants 48.000Hz, 2 channels, 24 bits.just play with it for a bit and be warned that it might change randomly when plugging in headphones, going to standby, restarting, etc.
 
and here's a an off-topic hint: when you plug headphones into your iphone/ipad the buffer size might double (e.g. from 512bytes to 1024 bytes), make sure you don't rely on the buffersize you requested!
 
This module gives you the opportunity to practise using engine diagnostic systems and will guide you to consult live data, find vital information, and identify faults using the many tools at your disposal. You will also use the Electude simulator to complete a work order for a defective injector with too high resistance.
 
The module takes around 90 minutes to complete. You will be continually tested as you work your way through the module, with a series of quizzes and other activities. Once you have completed all sections successfully, you will be awarded a downloadable WorldSkills UK certificate.
