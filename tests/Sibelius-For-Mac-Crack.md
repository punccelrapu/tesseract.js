Cannot download Sibelius Sounds
 Posted by clbobman - 12 Apr 01:25AM (edited 12 Apr 01:26AM) Hide picture Why am I unable to unpack Sibelius Sounds? Please help. it must be problem with the permissions on my SSD drive but I cannot figure it out. I cannot find the actual sounds installed anywhere on the SSD, so I cannot see if i can change the permissions. The Sibelius programme is installed on my normal drive. Could that be a problem. Thanks for any help.

Here is the error message: "There was a problem unpacking the data [Errno 13] Permission denied: / Volumes/Steve SSD Pro /Brass" 

I am using a Mac running High Sierra (version 10.13.6). Back to top | Allthreads Re: Cannot download Sibelius Sounds
 Posted by Robin Walker - 12 Apr 08:48AM Hide picture Probably the installer file that you downloaded over the internet was improperly truncated. Delete the sounds installer file that you have, and download a fresh copy from your Avid account. While the download is in progress, keep the computer connected to the mains power, and adjust the power settings of your computer so that it does not go to sleep or standby during the download. For instance, on Macs, check the option "Prevent computer from sleeping automatically when the display is off" in System Preferences -> Energy Saver.

As a double-check, the size of the downloaded ".dmg" file should be listed as around 25 GB. Anything less than that is useless.

 Posted by clbobman - 13 Apr 06:12AM Hide picture Strangely, Robin I cannot find the .dmg file for Sibelius Sounds anywhere on either of my drives. I imagine the default is the SSD drive. It is as if it never downloaded, but I know it downloaded a substantial part of the file at least because it was downloading for a long time.

I have bulk searched .dmg folders and I have basically erased all existing .dmg files on my drives just to make sure. However, when i go back to the the avid link downloader it creates a sibelius sound installer icon as if the pack is already downloaded and them gives the same "can't unpack" error message. I feel like I need an uninstaller. 

I have made sure the automatic screen saver/hard disk save is set to Never as you suggested if I do ever get to download the file again.

 Posted by clbobman - 13 Apr 11:25AM Hide picture Finally got it working by giving up on the Avid Link download section and downloading it again from the main download centre. It seems to be working pretty well. Crashing a bit when I am closing windows, but I now have better quality sounds than the midi. Thanks for your help Robin Back to top | Allthreads

Sib. 5.1: Stave outside margin
 Posted by sound-arc - 30 May 05:33AM Hide picture I am new to Sibelius so please be patient. I am working with an orchestral score that has been copied into Sibelius by someone else. I am trying to format the parts and the problem I have is that on the first page of the score the staves cross the margin on the right hand side. This means that the first system in my parts also crosses the margin line. I have searched sibelius reference but can't find how to make the system stay inside the margin. The person who created the files is away so I can't ask them. Can anyone help?

thanks Back to top | Allthreads Re: Sib. 5.1: Stave outside margin
 Posted by Terry Carter, Rural Michigan USA - 30 May 10:45AM Hide picture Will you confirm, please, that you have displayed the blue, dashed, margin lines and can see the staff across that line. 

Does the staff cross the edge of the paper? Is the problem the same on every page? Does the problem exist on the parts? All the parts?

 Posted by sound-arc - 30 May 11:44PM Hide picture Yes, I can see the blue line and on the first page of the score only, the system crosses this line but does not go over the edge of the page. In the parts only the first system crosses the blue line, all the others are fine as are all the other pages in the score but the first. Any ideas? Thanks.

 Posted by Terry Carter, Rural Michigan USA - 30 May 11:51PM (edited 30 May 11:53PM) Hide picture Try grabbing the right-side edge of the system and dragging it toward the left. Click just to the right of the right-side barline (centered up and down) and drag. Perhaps it's a one-time thing. If so, this quick fix should do it.

 Posted by Terry Carter, Rural Michigan USA - 31 May 12:15AM Hide picture Another possible way to move the right-side barline to the margin line is to copy the entire system. 

Hold the Control key down. Double click somewhere in one of the bars of that extended system. You should see a double purple box around the entire system ï¿½ all of the staves in that system. 

Press the R key. The entire system will copy itself and push its way into the manuscript after the original system. 

Then go back and create those double purple lines around the original system. 

Press the delete key. 

The right-side barline should align with the margin line. 

All of this is in the score, of course, not just in a part.

the end of the system that's poking into the page margin, and choose

Sib. 6.2: \*Removing\* extra ossia measures
 Posted by John Elliott - 10 May 10:05PM Hide picture Due to copying and pasting, I have ended up with an ossia staff that has continued well past its utility.

I would like to remove the extra measures back to the point where the ossia stops. However, all I can find in the manuals/references are ways to ADD an ossia staff.

Am I left to copy/paste the music I want to keep, remove the entire ossia, re-add it to \*just\* the length I want, and then re-paste the music back into it?

 Posted by Bob Zawalich - 10 May 10:37PM (edited 10 May 10:41PM) Hide picture As ossia staff is just an extra, small, staff attached to an instrument. The way it comes and goes is actually by Sib putting in instrument changes to No Instrument (Hidden) where it needs to be hidden.

Daniel discusses this in his current Sibelius blog entry: -ossia-staves-plug-in.

So if you want to hide an ossia past a certain point, use Create > Other > Instrument Change > All instruments > Others and pick No Instrument (Hidden).

If you only want to remove sections, it is trickier, but the same basic idea. Find the place you want it to be visible first, and put in an instrument change to the instrument that the ossia is attached to. Then put the No Instrument change at the point where you want the bar to disappear.

 Posted by John Elliott - 10 May 11:09PM Hide picture Thank you, Bob.

DEAR SIBELIUS:
Do you realize that "DELETE" or "OMIT" or "HIDE" -- say, when the measures are selected -- would be SO much easier (as regards the ossia staves) than "Create > Other > Instrument Change > All instruments > Others and pick No Instrument (Hidden).". The Sibelius "solution" to deleting extra ossia measures does not fit with the expectations of the end-user.

Sorry for any ALL CAPS above and below. It's not really "yelling" so much as me \*trying\* to emphasize my \*point\*: which is that the "solution" is REALLY BURIED and \*hardly\* intuitive.

The main problem stems from the fact that to \*remove\* an already created item (like an ossia staff) BEGINS in the CREATE menu. 

What? I thought I was trying to "destroy" something \*already\* CREATED.

In mother words, I am not trying to CREATE anything, I am trying to DESTROY (i.e.: remove / hide / delete / remove) something \*already\* created.

So, I EXPECT to start in a "DELETE / OMIT / REMOVE / HIDE" most at the very least.

Can you please see to fixing this? Or am I just really off-base considering this "solution" from a "logical" angle?

Sorry (again), and this time for the sarcasm, but this is hardly the first time I have run across such a convoluted solution in the recent months. 

I have been involved with product development at many point in my past and I guess the frustrations have just built up too much to allow for totally polite constructive criticism. I
