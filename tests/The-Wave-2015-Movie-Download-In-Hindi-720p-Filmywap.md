So we are introduced to a family unit and the central protagonist of the film, Geologist Kristian Eikjord (Kristoffer Joner) who alone seems to pick up on signs of an impending disaster and is finally vindicated, sadly, when a mountain pass collapses into the fjord Geiranger, creating a deadly tidal wave 85-metres high that rolls down to a scenic town (and the hotel where his wife works).
 
Technically the film is pretty well accomplished, with some surprisingly successful visual effects and convincing physical effects, like semi-submerged sets, water damage etc. The episodic nature is just the way things tend to be in these films (we have to get from here to there, and we have to get past this obstacle there etc) and its perhaps unfortunate that the film finally just oversteps the drama with a nod to **The Abyss** and a drowning/death scene that really slips, as the one **The Abyss** did, into overwrought nonsense that threatens to spoil everything.

A **slasher film** is a subgenre of horror films involving a killer or a group of killers stalking and murdering a group of people, usually by use of bladed or sharp tools.[1] Although the term "slasher" may occasionally be used informally as a generic term for any horror film involving murder, film analysts cite an established set of characteristics which set slasher films apart from other horror subgenres, such as monster movies, splatter films, supernatural and psychological horror films.[2]
 
When slasher films become franchises, they typically take on villain protagonist characteristics, with the series following the continued efforts of their antagonists, rather than any of the killer's disposable victims, including any individual entry's heroes or final survivor(s) (who, in so far as they continue to appear within the series, are often killed off immediately after their next on-screen appearance, which has become its own trope). Examples of antiheroes around whom the respective series have become centered include Michael Myers, Freddy Krueger, Jason Voorhees, Chucky and Leatherface.[15] The antagonist is envisioned and embedded into the public psyche as the main and most marketable/recognisable character, even if his screentime is dwarfed in any specific film by the nominal protagonists. The *Scream* film series is a rarity that follows its heroine Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) rather than masked killer Ghostface, whose identity changes from film to film, and is only revealed in each entry's finale.[16]
 
Another alleged trope frequently associated with slasher discourse - and horror more broadly - is that of the "black character(s) dying first" (often formulated as "*always* dying first"). Actual analyses of the films, such as a 2013 investigative piece in Complex, have found that the trope is largely self-mythologising as opposed to being a statistical reality (per Complex, in only 10% of the fifty analysed movies, all containing one or more speaking black characters, did any of them die first).[17]
 
The appeal of watching people inflict violence upon each other dates back thousands of years to Ancient Rome,[18] though fictionalized accounts became marketable with late 19th century horror plays produced at the Grand Guignol.[19] Maurice Tourneur's *The Lunatics* (1912) used visceral violence to attract the Guignol's audience. In the United States, public outcry over films like this eventually led to the passage of the Hays Code in 1930.[20] The Hays Code is one of the entertainment industry's earliest set of guidelines restricting sexuality and violence deemed unacceptable.[20][21]
 
Crime writer Mary Roberts Rinehart influenced horror literature with her novel *The Circular Staircase* (1908),[22] adapted into the silent film *The Bat* (1926), about guests in a remote mansion menaced by a killer in a grotesque mask.[23] Its success led to a series of "old dark house" films including *The Cat and the Canary* (1927), based on John Willard's 1922 stage play, and Universal Pictures' *The Old Dark House* (1932), based on the novel by J.B. Priestley.[23] In both films, the town dwellers are pitted against strange country folk, a recurring theme in later horror films. Along with the "madman on the loose" plotline, these films employed several influences upon the slasher genre, such as lengthy point of view shots and a "sins of the father" catalyst to propel the plot's mayhem.[24]
 
B-movie mogul Val Lewton produced *The Leopard Man* (1943), about a murderer framing his crimes against women on an escaped show leopard.[26] Basil Rathbone's *The Scarlet Claw* (1944) sees Sherlock Holmes investigate murders committed with a five-pronged garden weeder that the killer would raise in the air and bring down on the victim repeatedly, an editing technique that became familiar in the genre.[27] Robert Siodmak's *The Spiral Staircase* (1946), based on Ethel White's novel *Some Must Watch*, stars Ethel Barrymore as a sympathetic woman trying to survive black-gloved killers. *The Spiral Staircase* also features an early use of jump scares.[28]

Alfred Hitchcock's *Psycho* (1960) used visuals that had been deemed unacceptable by movie studios, including scenes of violence, sexuality, and the shot of a toilet flushing. The film featured an iconic score by Bernard Herrmann that has been frequently imitated in slasher and horror films.[33] That same year, Michael Powell released *Peeping Tom*, showing the killer's perspective as he murders women to photograph their dying expressions.[4][34]
 
*Psycho* was nominated for four Academy Awards, including Best Supporting Actress for Janet Leigh and Anthony Perkins garnering universal acclaim for his role as Norman Bates.[35][33] This notice drew bankable movie stars to horror films.[36] Joan Crawford starred in William Castle's *Strait-Jacket* (1964)[37] and in Jim O'Connolly's *Berserk!* (1967),[38] while Albert Finney starred in MGM's *Night Must Fall* (1964) (a remake of the 1937 British film)[39] and Peter Cushing starred in *Corruption* (1968).[40]
 
Francis Ford Coppola's debut, *Dementia 13* (1963), takes place in an Irish castle where relatives gather to commemorate a family death but are murdered one by one.[27] William Castle's *Homicidal* (1961) features gore in its murder scenes, something both *Psycho* and *Peeping* *Tom* had edited out.[44][45] Richard Hillard's *Violent Midnight* (1963) showed a black-gloved killer's point of view as they pull down a branch to watch a victim and also featured a skinny-dipping scene.[46] Crown International's *Terrified* (1963) features a masked killer.[47] Spain's *The House That Screamed* (1969) features violent murders and preempted later campus-based slashers.[48]
 
Post-World War II Germany adapted British writer Edgar Wallace's crime novels into a subgenre of their own called *Krimi* films.[52] The *Krimi* films were released in the late 1950s through the early 1970s and featured villains in bold costumes accompanied by jazz scores from composers such as Martin Bttcher and Peter Thomas.[27][53] *Fellowship of the Frog* (1959), about a murderer terrorizing London, was successful in America, leading to similar adaptations like *The Green Archer* (1961) and *Dead Eyes of London* (1961). The Rialto Studio produced 32 *Krimi* films between 1959 and 1970.[54]
 
Italy's *giallo* thrillers are crime procedurals or murder mysteries interlaced with eroticism and psychological horror.[49] *Giallo* films feature unidentified killers murdering in grand fashions.[49] Unlike most American slasher films the protagonists of *gialli* are frequently (but not always) jet-setting adults sporting the most stylish Milan fashions.[27] These protagonists are often outsiders reluctantly brought into the mystery through extenuating circumstances, like witnessing a murder or being suspected of the crimes themselves.[55] Much like *Krimi* films, *gialli* plots tended to be outlandish and improbable, occasionally employing supernatural elements.[27][49] Mario Bava's *A Bay of Blood* (1971) is a whodunit featuring a subplot depicting creative death sequences on a secluded lakeside setting, which greatly inspired *Friday the 13th* (1980), its 1981 sequel and subsequent slashers.[56][57] Sergio Martino's *Torso* (1973) featured a masked killer preying upon beautiful and promiscuous young women in retribution for a past misdeed. *Torso*'s edge-of-your-seat climax finds a sensible "final girl"[58] facing off with the killer in an isolated villa.[59][60] Umberto Lenzi's *Eyeball* (1975), which unfolds in an Agatha Christie manner, is noted by some as a slasher precursor, as American tourists are targeted by a killer wearing a red raincoat.[61][62]
 
By 1974 the exploitation film battled political correctness and their popularity waned, and while films like *The Love Butcher* (1975) and *The Redeemer: Son of Satan* (1976) were accused of promoting bigotry, the low-budget independent film *The Texas Chain Saw Massacre* (1974) became a major hit and the most commercially successful horror film since *The Exorcist*. The story concerns a violent clash of cultures and ideals between the counter-culture and traditional conservative values, with the film's squealing antagonist Leatherface carrying a chainsaw and wearing the faces of victims he and his family eat. *The Texas Chain Saw Massacre* spawned imitators and its false "based on a true story" advertisements gave way to reenactments of true crime. *The Town That Dreaded Sundown* (1976), based on the Phantom K
