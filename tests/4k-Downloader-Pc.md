The downloader was blank and there was no flight plan download option on the dispatch page. We were not sure if it was a result of the updates to the Navdata Center or FMS Data. All is good now.

Several years ago Microsoft published Office 2010 Starter. Office 2010 Starter was a free Office 2010, however some functions were disabled.
It installed only Microsoft Word and Excel and showed Microsoft advertisments during use.
 

Microsoft Starter 2010 works with a virtualization technology like V-App. It does not really install Office on your computer, but a virtualized office (like Office in a virtual machine).
To do this it creates a drive Q: which is not user accessable . If you are using drive Q: already, Office 2010 Starter won't work.

Office 2010 Starter could be installed using a setup (**SetupConsumerC2ROLW.exe**) which downloaded the installation files from internet.
Sometime around 2012, Microsoft pulled the plug, so the installation files couldn't be downloaded anymore.
 
A few days ago, I found the old executable and behold, I got it working again on my old computer with Windows 10 installed.
So Microsoft quietly activated the Office 2010 Starter files again, but will they pull the plug again in the near future ?
 

I found out that if the installation files are available locally, the setup won't need internet during the installation.
However the setup does not keep the files after installation, so I had to figure out how to get the installation files together locally.
Monitoring the installation I got some partial information how to download all the installation files needed.

This information was used to create the **Office 2010 Starter downloader v1.0**.
Be ware, this script works as is. Not a lot of error checking has been put in place. E.g. I do not check for downlad errors, but every language folder should be about 700 - 900 MB.

 
Thanks for the wonderful tool and script.
On Linux, installation with wine has an issue:
The script (Both version E and F) couldn't load update directory files and office setup program refuses to install by saying corrupted installation file.
The script (version F) itself terminates with the following error message:

 
You can try the download part on a Windows box and copy the "\bin\" folder. Then run the installation since you've got all the files but, then again, it'll try to make a Q: drive and run it from that and, good luck with wine handling that
 
That error is likely due to the fact that the InternetExplorer com objects aren't loaded in wine? 
I believe this line is the actual culprit: $oHTTP = ObjCreate("WinHttp.WinHttpRequest.5.1") in this func:
 
I have downloaded allthe necessary files from a windows 10 machine and copied them to my linux installation without any issue for two different language sets. (I made the full installaton on that windows machine also wtihout any issues.)
 
No clue why it works nor why wouldn't. I don't think they support this version anyway. In any case, I got it to work in English from the US a few days back. Maybe is country dependent. But again, no clue.
 
Folks, these aren't the supportforums for old microsoft installers. The AutoIt3Part works perfectly and downloads the files. 
So maybe try to find a forum that has more takers for these kind of issues?
 
I want to download everything stored in my adobe lightroom cloud (about 107gb) to an external drive. Lightroom Downloader is the tool for that so I installed it. When I selected the destination folder it gives me an error that says "not enough space" despite the external drive having more than 2tb available. I have also tried saving to my Mac HD which I have 500gb available, and get the same error.
 
This might be a long shot, but how much space is on the internal drive? I know your final destination is the external drive, but perhaps Lightroom makes a temporary copy to the internal drive first? Yes, this is speculation, but I have a vague recollection of something about this. It may also be completely wrong.
 
So I just realized that currently I pay for 100gb of adobe cloud. And I am using 107gb, meaning I've been getting error messages saying the cloud is full and I need to upgrade my plan. I am wondering if this may be contributing to the issue? Either way though I should be able to remove the things that are in the cloud (because I don't want to upgrade). I didn't even want all these items there anyway, photos on my phone were automatically synced with creative cloud when I downloaded the Lightroom iOS app. Very frustrating....
 
Unfortunately, there is no other version of the Downloader available.

It is possible for the downloads to be created by us manually and emailed to you as a series of zip files. It is a very slow process however.
 
It looks like the Adobe Lightroom Downloader tries to make a copy on my internal disk, because she is now full...But I would like to use the external drive just because of the missing space on my internal drive. )I do not have 100 GB left there, but some 20 GB)
 
The files in the LR-cloud in total use 11,7GB in the cloud. The downloader app says, that my target-folder to download the files is not big enough. But it is, with 2 TG it should work. Can someone help?
 
Hello, I'm looking for a good **Facebook video downloader** for my Windows 11 computer. I've tried several before, but none of them seemed ideal. Either they had too many annoying ads, or they were not safe enough to use. I mainly want to download some tutorial videos for offline viewing and learning. Can anyone recommend a tool that is both safe and stable? I hope it's easy to use and virus-free. If you have any good recommendations, please let me know. Thank you very much!
 
I have used a download tool called AIIClipDown myself before and I think it is pretty good. It supports multiple platforms, including Facebook video downloads. It is very simple to use, the interface is also very clear, and I did not encounter any problems with ads or viruses when I used it. Highly recommend!
 
Among the many network requests, I found one with a video file format (usually MP4 or MPEG). I copied the URL of this request, pasted it directly in a new browser tab and visited it, and the facebook video started downloading.
 
Although this method does not require any third-party Facebook video downloader software, it does require some basic technical knowledge, such as knowing how to use the browser's developer tools and how to identify network requests for video files. If you are willing to spend some time learning the technical details, this is definitely a safe and effective download method.
 
Did you know that Facebook's "Save Video" link in the ellipsis menu isn't actually for saving the video to your local storage? Instead, it saves the video to your "Saved Videos" section on Facebook, where you can organize it into collections to watch later. However, if the video owner deletes it, you'll no longer have access to it.
 
To download a Facebook video to your computer, follow these steps: First, click the three-dot ellipsis menu on a video and select Copy link. (Note that this option may not be available for private videos.) This will redirect you to the mobile version of the page. Then, right-click on the video in the new tab and select Open link in new tab. In this new tab, you'll see only the video, and you can right-click again and select Save video as to download it to your PC.
 
Staying ahead of Facebook's ever-changing code to block online downloaders can be a challenge. As of October 2021, FB Video Downloader remains the most reliable option for effortlessly downloading Facebook videos. You can access this tool on your computer, Android, iPhone, or iPad. If FDownloader isn't working for you or you'd prefer an alternative method, you can still download the video by utilizing the "View page source" feature in your web browser. This approach may require a bit more effort, but **Facebook video downloader online** is still recommended as the more straightforward solution.
 
After downloading is complete, you can find the video in your default downloads folder. Look for the file with a ".mp4" extension. If you choose a lower quality setting than the original video, we recommend selecting "Render" first, followed by "Download". Rendering may take a bit longer as FDownloader performs some additional processing in the background.
 
I definitely don't recommend**online Facebook video downloader for PC** because I've had some issues with these online services before. First, security is a big issue. These sites are often full of pop-up ads and possible malware links. A few times, after I clicked download on these sites, not only did the video not download, but some suspicious ads popped up or prompted me to install some unnecessary software. This made me doubt the security of such services.
 
In addition, the dependency of these websites also made me a little worried. Once, I needed to download an important facebook video file, but the website suddenly became inaccessible and displayed a server error. This instability made me feel very inconvenienced in an emergency.
