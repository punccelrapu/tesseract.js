For the industrial production of chocolate and chocolate products, a three-year training course has been set up in Germany to train people as specialists in confectionery technology.[1] The Central Technical School of the German Confectionery Industry (ZDS) in Solingen offers further education and training.[2]
 
Traditionally, chocolatiers, especially in Europe, are trained through an apprenticeship with other chocolatiers. It is now common for chocolatiers to start out as pastry or confectionery chefs, or attend culinary training specifically for working with chocolate. Being a master chocolatier involves perfecting the art of working with chocolate to create desserts as well as skillfully creating pieces of art with chocolate. Chocolatiers must understand the physical and chemical aspects of chocolate, to not only create chocolates and other confections, but also to create sculptures and centrepieces. Perfecting the technical aspects of design and developing the art of flavor takes many years of practice.[3]

There are a variety of culinary schools and specialty chocolate schools, including the Ecole Chocolat Professional School of Chocolate Arts in Canada,[4] and The Chocolate Academy by Callebaut, with over 20 different schools around the world.[5] The French Culinary Institute offers pastry and confectionery courses that are said to help a chocolatier learn the trade.[6]
 
In order to become a chocolatier, a person must first of all learn how to make chocolate. With increasing levels of difficulty, they learn the working techniques for creating handmade works of art, which above all have to taste good. Training usually begins with how to make chocolate from a variety of ingredients. Once trainees have learned how to make chocolate and begin to understand the physical and chemical aspects of chocolate, they can work with chocolate in many different applications. Since chocolate is a versatile food, various courses offer knowledge about different techniques for processing chocolate. Only when you are well trained in all uses of chocolate or have specialized in a specific application are you considered a chocolatier. Continuing education and courses can lead to a better understanding of the ingredients of chocolate and how sculpting can be used to create amazing chocolate masterpieces.[7][8]
 
Once a chocolatier has mastered the artistry of chocolate, they may be considered a Master Chocolatier. The best of these compete in The World Chocolate Masters, a chocolate competition that started in 2005.[10] Leading chocolatiers include Naomi Mizuno (Japan),[11] Francisco Torreblanca (Spain),[11] Pierre Marcolini (Belgium),[12] Yvonnick Le Maux (France),[11] and Carmelo Sciampagna (Italy).[11] Mizuno won the World Chocolate Masters competition in 2007. The competition was judged in four different categories: molded pralines, hand-dipped pralines, gastronomic chocolate dessert, small chocolate showpiece, and creative chocolate showpiece.[13] At 28, Mizuno was the youngest competitor from his nation. He is employed at Futaba Pastry.[14]
