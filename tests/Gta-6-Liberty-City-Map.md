The area is roughly bound by NW 79th Street to the north, NW 27th Avenue to the west, the Airport Expressway to the South, and Interstate 95 to the east. The neighborhood is home to one of the largest concentrations of African Americans in South Florida, as of the 2000 census.[1][2] Although it was often known as "**Model City**" both historically and by the City of Miami government, residents more commonly call it Liberty City.

Once part of the sparsely populated outskirts of northern Miami, what became Liberty City developed during the Great Depression of the 1930s when President Franklin D. Roosevelt authorized the construction of the Liberty Square housing project in 1933, the first of its kind in the Southern United States. Built as a response to the deteriorating housing conditions in densely populated and covenant-restricted slums of Overtown, construction on the initial housing project began in 1934 and it opened in 1937.
 
Into the 1940s and 1950s, the growing Liberty City and adjacent Brownsville thrived as a middle-income black American community, hosting several churches, hospitals, and community centers. The area served as home to prominent figures such as Kelsey Pharr, M. Athalie Range (the first black American elected to serve on the Miami city commission) and boxer Muhammad Ali. Although segregation laws prohibited black Americans from resting and residing in popular Miami Beach, service establishment and resorts such as the Hampton House Motel and Villas catered to and entertained the likes of notables such as Martin Luther King Jr., Althea Gibson, and even whites such as Mickey Mantle.
 
Construction of Interstate 95 in Florida in Overtown and declining use of restrictive covenants in the wake of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 dramatically altered the neighborhood into the 1960s. Increasing numbers of lower-income elderly and welfare-dependent families migrated to Liberty City after their displacement primarily from inner city Overtown, turning the area into a dangerous ghetto, leading to large-scale black flight of middle- and higher-income blacks and other blacks like West Indian Americans largely to suburban areas like Florida City and Miami Gardens in southern and northern Dade County, respectively.

The plight of inner-city black Miamians increasingly came to be highlighted in national press into the 1980s as the University of Miami Hurricanes football team won several national college football championships led by players recruited mostly from black, lower-income neighborhoods such as Liberty City and Overtown. National exposure continued with the popularity of nationally broadcast programs such as the NBC crime drama *Miami Vice*, which brought the deteriorating conditions of the area to greater prominence.
 
Into the 1990s and 2000s, music grew to reflect the area, with locals such as Luther Campbell of 2 Live Crew pioneering the Miami bass genre, which dominated Southern hip hop during the decade. Other music and sports talents rose to national prominence from the area such as rappers Trina and Trick Daddy, NBA player Udonis Haslem and NFL players Chad "Ocho Cinco" Johnson, Antonio Brown, and Willis McGahee.
 
Climate change is affecting the value of flood-prone real estate in Miami.[3] Miami neighborhoods with higher elevations such as Liberty City are experiencing increasing real estate values.[4] By 2017, Liberty City, along with Little Haiti, started becoming more attractive to investors.[5][4] A community land trust is planned to maintain affordability for current residents.[6] Home prices appreciated more slowly in 2018 in Miami Beach and lower-elevation areas of Miami-Dade County.[3]
 
In 2000, 2.7% of the population spoke little to no English. The percentage of residents born in Florida was 74.5%, the percentage of people born in another U.S. state was 16.7%, and the percentage of native residents but born outside the U.S. was 0.8%, while the percentage of foreign born residents was 7.9%.[8]
 
This rendition of Liberty City has versions of four of the five boroughs of New York City, plus New Jersey. Brooklyn is **Broker**, Queens is **Dukes**, Manhattan is **Algonquin**, and The Bronx is **Bohan**. The state and city of New Jersey is Alderney, which is separate from Liberty City. The only borough not to be recreated in the game is Staten Island. Although in the game, Liberty City appears to be an isolated set of islands, the rest of America is actually nearby. Rockstar Games stated that they avoided placing unreachable pieces of land in the distance to retain the city's "complete" feel.
 
*Grand Theft Auto IV* and its two episodes (*The Lost and Damned* and *The Ballad of Gay Tony*) use the same full rendition of the city. However, a small number of different locations are accessible in the different episodes. *Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars* uses the entire city apart from neighbouring Alderney State, although some locations are slightly altered in terms of height and elevation for the isometric 3D perspective of the game.
 
Liberty City is divided into 56 individual and unique neighbourhoods which are spread across four boroughs within Liberty City and border the neighboring state of Alderney, including Alderney City. Whereas the 3D Universe version of Liberty City was partly located on the mainland, the *GTA IV* version is completely made up of islands.
 
**Algonquin** (Manhattan)
*Self-proclaimed center of everything*

A bustling commercial/business district full of amazing towering skyscrapers and a varied composition of cultures. Here holds various famous landmarks, such as Star Junction (Times Square), Middle Park (Central Park), and the Rotterdam Tower (Empire State Building). This part of Liberty City is the busiest, most crowded, and has more buildings, skyscrapers, and everything in between. It is the heart of Liberty City. There is a lot of nightlife and clubs. Clubs are Hercules, Maisonette 9 and Bahama Mamas.
 
**Broker** (Brooklyn)
*An ex-city on its own*

A distinct ex-city on its own, it maintains a distinct character apart from the rest of the city. Contains various pockets of housing projects. Some areas are distinct for high crime rate. Also contains a mix of trendy middle-class neighborhoods. Famous for its brownstones. This is the borough in which Niko Bellic initially arrives to Liberty City.
 
**Dukes** (Queens)
*Old, ethnically-diverse and affluent*

An old ethnically-diverse, predominantly-residential area, it is the location of the Francis International Airport and the baseball stadium that is home to the Liberty City Swingers, and an Irish pub, the Steinway Beer Garden. **Dukes** is primarily made up of affluent and ethnically diverse middle to upper-class residential neighborhoods that use traditional Irish, Victorian and Tudor architecture; though some neighborhoods follow the typical modern New York archetype. Also contains a minority of more working class areas.
 
**Bohan** (Bronx)
*Multi-cultural ghettos*

The birthplace of the culture of rap and hip-hop. Also famous for its Latino culture. Largely consists of expansive run down housing projects and is home to the St.Mary's Community Project led by Manny Escuela. Notorious for higher crime rates, gang violence and drug trafficking over the other boroughs. Bohan is the smallest island.
 
The earliest settlement that would eventually become Liberty City was established in 1609, when the Dutch hired the English explorer Horatio Humboldt to find a new location for them to sell marijuana. Humboldt eventually sailed into the Humboldt River, which had coincidentally been named that way by the natives (according to Humboldt's account). The Dutch soon established a colony on the banks of the river and immigrants from all over Europe emigrated to the settlement find out what freedom was truly like in the colony of New Rotterdam, which promised convenience stores and public hangings, as well as the possibility of purchasing slaves thanks to a slave trade craze which swept the nascent colony ever since the first slave ship arrived. Within the span of a few years, the Dutch had become a minority in their own colony, and the East India Trading company hired Gloria Hole to return New Rotterdam to a "civilised" state. Eventually, the English took over New Rotterdam, which was based on a slender island named Algonquin after an old Indian word with the same pronunciation, after the settlers signed a petition to be ruled by the English instead of the Dutch.
 
The small colony soon expanded with the rising level of immigration, establishing settlements on three neighboring islands. The first consisted of both Broker, named after the King of England's bastard son who was conceived by a milk maid and the other Dukes, after the term Duky because the people living there smelled like excrement. Alderney was named after an American settler called Phillip D'Alderney, the only man who could bear living in the swampy industrial island. The smallest island was named Bohan after a Dutch word that meant "Dutch word". The British and the Americans fought in what was to be known as the American Revolution for freedom from British taxes, and after receiving a statue of a transvestite eating ice cream from the French, the Americans won and removed the Union Jack and melting the statue of King George into chains, toilet seats and gold teeth. The capitol of the young nation was soon changed to Washington D.C. and all of Liberty City's politicians moved there. The next century saw the massive immigration of the Irish into Liberty City, displacing African-Americans as the primary source of labor. The tensions between the North and South over slavery boiled over into a civil war, with riots bre
