Customers in New Jersey can go to the mobile and online sportsbook that Bet365 offers. Their partner in the state is Hard Rock Casino, AC, and they launched in August 2019. The Garden State was their first official branch in the USA, but they don't plan on stopping there.
 
September 2022 marked the launch of Bet365 Colorado. The brand has a partnership with Century Casinos, and it was speculated that the launch date was targeted, so they can provide betting for the 2022 NFL season. Bet365 Colorado was a confirmed thing even back in May 2020, but they didn't launch in the state until more than two years later.
 
Bet365 will abide by the specific laws and regulations of the Centennial State. Most of them are similar to Ohio's, including the e-sports and amateur sports laws. The two key differences are that while both states can offer betting on awards or drafts if they are on the approved list, Colorado doesn't allow player prop bets or betting on the Heisman Trophy.
 
On January 1st, 2023 legal betting became a possibility in Ohio, and Bet365 got a license to operate via a partnership with the Cleveland Guardians. Bet365 Ohio's license doesn't approve retail betting, but you can bet with them online once you register an account.
 
There are a few key facts about Ohio sports betting, that Bet365 Ohio has to abide by. For example, you won't find any wagers for amateur or high school sports, but college betting and Olympics bets are allowed. E-sports will only be allowed if they are approved by the Ohio Casino Control Commission.

Also, you won't find any bets on the actions of coaches, referees, and any other person or group outside of the players in the game is prohibited. Outcomes determined by chance are also not allowed, like betting on a coin flip.
 
Bet365 Virginia opened its doors in January 2023 and became an official partner of the NFL's Washington Commanders. Since then, residents of Virginia have been able to take advantage of the Bet365 application and website.
 
Since September 2023, BET365's website and mobile app have been available in Kentucky. The bookmaker has partnered with Sandy's Gaming and Racing to bring its extensive betting market to Kentucky players.
 
Bet365 became available in the state of Louisiana in November 2023, after signing a partnership with Charlotte Hornets. This is the fourth and final state to be opened by the British bookmaker this year. The people of Louisiana were therefore the last of 2023 to access bet365's sports betting offer and its various promotions.
 
Thanks to a partnership with the Ak-Chin Indian Community, Bet365 is available in Arizona since February 2024. Bet365 not only offers high-quality sports betting services but also demonstrates its commitment to the community! The company has pledged to donate $1 million to the Ak-Chin Indian community as a sign of good faith and commitment to the community. This launch is a huge expansion for bet365! It further establishes its presence in the United States as one of the best sports betting platform.
 
North Carolina is the latest state where Bet365 has become available and established a great partnership with Charlotte Hornets of the NBA. Since March 2024, residents of NC can place bets on the platform.
 
Legal sports betting in the USA has come a long way and now it's available in 35 states. Ten other states are in the process of legalizing sports betting, while seven other states are unlikely to legalize it (AK, HI, ID, NE, SC, TX, UT)
 
Bet365 is partnered with Empire Resorts, and they offer a retail sportsbook (Resorts World Catskills Casino) in New York. That sportsbook has been operating since 2019 when retail betting was the only form of gambling legal in the Empire State. Online betting launched in early January 2022, but Bet365 couldn't get a license to operate online in the state.
 
The company is **trusted by millions of people**, not only in the US, and it keeps its customers' data safe. They employ only professionals who help keep their systems checked and put up the latest firewalls and data protection protocols to keep everything secure and confidential.
 
Each country offers different bet365 sign up offers or bonus codes and betting options depending on the location, but most offers are similar in types and amounts. Most countries provide the same bonuses and features, but some places, like Spain, Italy, and Denmark, have unique versions.
 
As we mentioned before, in the USA, Bet365 is currently available in 10 states. **Mobile betting at Bet365 is legal in** **USA** as long as you remain in a state which allows sports betting to take place. It's the same thing, like with any other legal bookmakers like Fox Bet NJ.
 
Bet365 is available in some African countries, such as: Kenya, Ivory Coast, Cameroon, Uganda. But there are those countries who haven't accepted the bookmaker, and you can't use their services from there. Residents of those countries may consider using the 22bet app instead.
 
Oceania is made up of many countries but most notably **Australia, where Bet365 has a special license**. Bet365 is one of only several bookmakers worldwide that can offer all the Australian sports to the rest of the world. This is unique and gives them even more popularity in the country.
 
They are also available in other countries from this part of the world, including: New Zealand, Samoa, Indonesia, Solomon Islands, Papua New Guinea, Vanuatu, French Polynesia, Fiji Islands, New Caledonia.
 
European countries that are restricted are Turkey, France, Belgium, Netherlands, Portugal, Poland, and Romania. In South America, they aren't available in Colombia, Venezuela and French Guiana. In Oceania, you wouldn't be able to bet from the Philippines. Other smaller countries are also on the restricted list, but the most prominent one is the USA. This is because Bet365 has only acquired a license in New Jersey, Colorado, Ohio, and Virginia, or because, in other states, sports betting isn't available. As Bet365 spreads to more US states in the future, we expect the country to be removed from the ban list.
 
If you are traveling to another country and you still want to have a little fun and bet on the Bet365 platform, you have the opportunity to do so. Keep in mind that the markets and sports available on the platform would be different depending on your location. The features available would also have slight differences but not too much.
 
For example, there are more features available in the United Kingdom, considering Horse Racing is a big part of the culture there. Still, here in the US, Bet365 doesn't offer Horse Racing or Greyhounds, so such features are obsolete. You will have to get familiar with the site's terms and conditions in the respected country, so you don't break any of them.
 
Another thing you should keep in mind is that while traveling abroad, you can log in to your account and maybe even make deposits and withdrawals. You can see how your on-going bets are going, and see the available markets and odds.
 
The app for US customers and customers in other countries is different, so you will have to download the NJ app, CO app, OH app, and VA app, via the App Store or Google Play if you are in New Jersey, Colorado, Ohio, or Virginia. If you are located abroad, you can check the app store if you have an iPhone or iPad, but if you own an Android, you will have to check Bet365's mobile site.
 
Yes, you can. You can log in and access the platform via the mobile site, which is user-friendly and easy-to-navigate. The only requirement is that you download a special browser plug-in before logging in to your account.
