Port Saturn is in a fictional city somewhere in the USA with the Union Pacific servicing the port and the industries within the area. Go through the neighbourhoods as you head to either the northern part or the southern part of the harbour. Service the industries by taking containers from the loading stations over to the unloaders or simply take some coke coal from loader over to the aluminum plant. 

Port Saturn is inspired from another route that was made for TS2010.

This is a quay with large crane and animation for container harbour (at first you dig 20 m under the ground nivel along a straight line like at left on thumbnail, then you place the quay to see properly the wall and after it you can fill with water and put under it some grass texture to have a better water texture). You can load a lot of container ships (see container ship from Vulcan, kuid: 60238) and others containers (kuid:427808, Pierreren). See -fr.blogspot.com
 
We are taking a cruise out of Rotterdam in just over a week. We could like a reccomendation on an affordable, clean, hotel, close to the cruise port. Someone on another travel site suggested The Tulip Inn, which may be just fine. We would welcome anyone's opinion on this hotel or others. We will only be there for a day, and would be really great if the hotel was walking distance to some of the remarkable areas in the city. Also, we would appreciate suggestions on the most affordable and safe transportation from the airport to the hotel or areas you suggest. My wife packs a lot, and we will probably each have 2 suitcases. Thanks,

I've never stayed the night in Rotterdam, but if the cruise dock is where I think it is, I doubt you would want to stay in that area. There are several business class hotels right downtown, rather close to the main rail station. The easiest way to get from the airport (Schipol, I assume), is just to take the next train from the airport station to Rotterdam, then take a taxi to which ever hotel you choose. No need to buy rail tickets in advanced. Rotterdam isn't really the coziest city you'll encounter in Europe. It looks a lot like many US cities, but somewhat cleaner. One attraction worth visiting, if you're into that sort of thing, is Trainz Miniworld. It's neither as big nor as elaborate as Hamburg's famous Miniatur Wunderland, but perhaps worth a quick peak if you're in town.
 
Thank you Tom. Maybe we should stay in a business hotel close to the main rail station. It's probably central to everything. Hopefully, getting a ride to the port from that area is not too long of a ride or too pricey. I just haven't had time to research this and appreciate your response. Will also check out Trainz Miniworld, time permitting. Thanks again.
 
If flying from London, Rotterdam would be much closer to Delft than Amsterdam. The only reason we flew into Amsterdam is the direct flight from Washington, DC. If flying into London, surprised that you are not boarding at Harwich.
 
Are you taking Holland America's Rotterdam next Saturday? Which airport are you using? Rotterdam doesn't have a lot to offer in the way of an old European city. Because of its importance, the Allies during WWII reduced the whole area to six feet of rubble. It was rebuilt as a modern, industrial city and port. The are many more interesting place to see and stay in that area other than Rotterdam. If you stay in the train station area, you can easily catch a tram from the station to the Hollard American HQ and check-in area. Someone at the ticket office will direct you to the correct tram. After a couple of minutes on the tram will see the Holland American HQ and cannot miss the stop. Maybe five mins from the train station. From the tram stop it is a 50 yard walk to the check-in point. The last time we boarded there we stayed in Delft. This time we are staying in Haarlem and coming over around 1 pm to Rotterdam. We are staying on till Rome. PS You don't need two large suitcase. We get by with a total of three carryon size bags - two backpack style and one rolling. Be creative with your packing.
 
Hello Frank, We are cruising on the Holland America Rotterdam on September 28th. Are you? We are flying into London, and connecting to The Hague Airport, (RTM). Is Dealft and Haarlem relatively close by? What is there? If we stayed in one of those places, could you recommend a clean and affordable hotel? Also, I know what you are saying about suitcases, but my wife doesn't compromise on that! Thanks for your suggestions. Regards,

Delft sits closer to Rotterdam than Haarlem, and it's right next to Den Haag. Although definitely more scenic than Rotterdam, it has one major disadvantage in your case. The historic center is mostly car free to non-residents, and the rail station sits a little bit outside. You may not be able to catch a taxi directly to your hotel, which could pose a problem with two bags each. Rotterdam may not look as cute, but the logistics might prove easier for you to arrange. PS- Rotterdam wasn't destroyed by the Allies, the Luftwaffe pummeled it as a warning to the Dutch after they put up an unexpectedly stiff resistance to the German invasion. There was a pretty good Dutch movie, Het Bombardment, released about this event last year.
 
Same boat. We actually sailed on the same ship out of Rotterdam two years to Athens. At that time we stayed in the Hotel Leeuwenbrug (leeuwenbrug.hl) in Delft. Great little hotel right on a canal. I am sure a taxi can get to it but we walked to it. Two, maybe 3 blocks directly across the canal in front the station. Actually spent two night with a day in The Hague. The tram connection to the station in Rotterdam was about 15 mins via the tram. The memory is shaky but it was fairly quick. Delft is really a very quaint and lovely place to stay. And, of course, Delft pottery !! This time we are flying into Amsterdam for a few days and staying in Haarlem. Something is going on in Amsterdam that week which made reasonable reservations hard to come by so we are staying in Haarlem which is about 10 min train ride from Amsterdam. Haarlem is about 45 mins via train to Rotterdam. Our plan is to leave Haarlem around 12:30 so we can checkin around two. PS I sent you a PM.
 
They did, but the damage was mostly limited to the harbor and industrial areas. Modern Rotterdam looks much the way it does now, however, because of the ferocious Rotterdam Blitz, which almost completely flattened the old town.
 
The cruise terminal is an up-and-coming area. There are two hotels near the cruise terminal - the Hotel New York (the historical HQs of Holland America Line) and another one. You can also book of of the hotels on the opposite bank of the Maas, where you'd be within walking distance of the Euromast, the Erasmusbrug, the Maritime Museum, the Museum of Archiotecture and, with some extra walking, the Cube Houses. Rotterdam has a lively dining scene.
 
Andre,   
we did book a hotel on the opposite side of the bank called the Inntel. It's good to know that some of the points of interest are walking distance. I'm curious about the cube houses too. Wish we had time to do and see more, but we will literally be in Rotterdam area for 24 hours. Then onto the cruise ship. You mentioned good variety of restaurants. Hope to find out what foods they are known for. Thanks for responding. Phil
 
The harbour itself is an attraction for the nautical-minded. It is among the top three freight movers in the world. You will see some of it from your own ship but there are cruises with commentary available, plus a maritimes museum on the edge of the centre. -to-do/museums/harbour-museum-rotterdam/   
Rotterdam has a good share of brown cafes, the Low Countries' answer to pubs, often with hearty food. Beer snobs should seek out places serving Belgian specialties. Another possibility is the Pelgrim, a brewpub in one of the few harbourfront neighbourhoods that weren't obliterated. It is next door to the church where the pilgrims are said to have embarked on their voyage via the British Isles to America. -to-go/attractions/5140/brewery-de-pelgrim/
 
I will definitely be seeking out the Pelgrim, sounds like a neat place to have a beer, and see a neighborhood that wasn't destroyed. Sounds like there are things worthwhile to do there. I will find the harbour interesting, being that I worked in the cargo industry for 21 years. The cube houses, the Pencil,Trainz Miniworld, museums, and some brown cafes will keep us plenty busy. Keep the information coming! And thanks to all.
 
A few months ago I showed this route on a French trainz forum and a person was kind enough to give me a Sacr-Cœur model for blender. All I have to do now is import it into trainz and then this will be more accurate to real life.
